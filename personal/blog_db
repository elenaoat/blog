469	Aware of awareness\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.000229-05	Today I got a chance to sneak in to the brand new Epicenter in Stockholm and attend an event about mindfulness.\r\nThe speaker was a researcher that worked with Google on a program related to emotional intelligence (EQ).\r\nAccording to him, humans are the only living creatures on Earth that can be aware of their awareness (and maybe dolphins too). And since we are such capable creatures, we are able to control our response to a stimulus.\r\n\r\nYou would ask yourself, aren't you already controlling your reaction? Yes, I guess you are. After all, you are the one who responds to an action. However, how conscious are you of your response?\r\n\r\nI will give you an example. Suppose, your boss calls you home and tells you that you forgot to do something very important that costed his company lots of money. He will tell you that you have to fix this immediately. Naturally, you will become very agitated or you might even panic. Because of this your breathing and your heartbeat will become rapid and if you don't take control of yourself, you might cause even more problems (for example, scream at your spouse, kids, or just mess up while trying to correct the situation). In fact, most don't realize that this doesn't only affect your relationships with those at work or at home, but it also affects you on a biochemical level. The thoughts and feelings that arise due to stimuli influence our genes and brain cells. And I would guess that in the above mentioned situation the feelings a regular person experiences aren't exactly very helpful for our well-being.\r\n\r\nSo the idea brought by the speaker was that it's worth learning to pause before reacting to a condition.\r\nHe called it "the gap" - the interval between the condition arousal and your response. In other words, it's about making a conscious choice about how you react.\r\n	Humans are the only living creatures on Earth that can be aware of their awareness (and maybe dolphins too).

And I would guess that in the above mentioned situation the feelings a regular person experiences aren't exactly very helpful for our well-being.\r\n\r\nSo the idea brought by the speaker was that it's worth learning to pause before reacting to a condition.\r\nHe called it "the gap" - the interval between the condition arousal and your response. In other words, it's about making a conscious choice about how you react.\r\n	\N
471	Domino effect?\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.02037-05	Couple of days ago, I have experienced a feeling of frustration and anger, which doesn't happen that often to me anymore. As a side note, this positive change I attribute to raising my awareness. However, I realize now that an entire chain of events has caused it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, that's my desire to please some people. My sister-in-law has invited me for a dinner and I agreed. This was a weekday and I left rather late from work. She cooks quite well and usually we have lots of food when we meet. And just like the other times, I've had quite large portion. I would like to think that the reasons I eat at their home so much are:\r\n\r\nwe usually only sit at the table (instead of taking a walk together or at least moving the food away from the table)\r\n\r\nI am trying to be nice with her and eat her food\r\n\r\nI am not being assertive enough. I could have told her that I am going to eat just salad.\r\n\r\nSee, the thing is that I've a different diet from them. I almost don't eat any proteins or fats and almost no processed foods. I don't eat cakes or chocolate. They eat it all. So sometimes when my sister-in-law does a nice cake I have a hard time refusing a piece - not because I have cravings for the sweet, but not to upset her.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this large dinner "rewarded" me with an almost sleepless night. As expected, I was rather tired the next day. Now, another person I am trying to please - my boss. And it doesn't matter who is the boss. Perhaps, that's not rare. Thanks to my awareness yet again, the situation has improved recently. When I am tired though, I let things go. And since I was tired from the last night, it was easy to follow my usual tendencies to overly please my boss. That in turn caused me to feel pitiful about myself.\r\n\r\nI like to think that these things will change as soon as I re-program my mind. I reckon that the idea of pleasing the boss comes from my unconscious. But that's a topic for another discussion.\r\n	Negative thoughts and frustration can be a result of an entire chain of events.\r	domino-effect?	personal-development	Domino effect?\r	\N	Negative thoughts and frustration can be a result of an entire chain of events.\r	\N	Couple of days ago, I have experienced a feeling of frustration and anger, which doesn't happen that often to me anymore.

494	Getting from Arlanda Airport to Stockholm city center	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	If you ever get to travel to Stockholm and land at Arlanda airport here is the way you may get to city center.\r\nIn fact, there are a few. I will start from the cheapest and will go to the fastest/most expensive options.\r\n\r\n1. Flygbussarna or airport shuttle - the airport bus which runs between City Terminal in the center of Stockholm and Arlanda airport. Cost is 99 Swedish crowns (around 10,50 euros). Has WiFi onboard, which is pretty handy. They accept credit cards and cash if you want to buy from the driver. There are also automated machines in the terminal and even outside from which you can buy the ticket.\r\nThe trip is around 30-50 minutes, depending on the traffic. So if in a hurry and want to avoid stress, better choose another option. The bus stops at several stops along the way.\r\n2. There is a new airport shuttle - Air Shuttle - which just started running from the airport to the city center. It costs the same as the previous bus.\r\n3. Train. You may take just the train, which is cheaper than a bus. However, the catch is that the airport will charge you an airport fee on exit/entrance from/to the airport. So in the end you will pay even more for the ticket.\r\n4. Arlanda Express. The ecological and fastest way to travel between city center and airport. Also pretty comfy. They have cool high-tech toilets there too :D Costs around twice the price of the bus. Has WiFi onboard too and charging outlets. Tickets could be bought at the airport terminal at the least or inside the train itself.\r\nThe trip would take around 20 minutes, that's because the train doesn't stop anywhere besides the airport terminals.\r\n5. You may also consider Uber, of course. Which is waaay pricier than the rest of the options. It's around 750 crowns (80 euros)! But yeah, if you are into lux travelling, then that's the way to do it! By the way, regular taxes are almost twice cheaper, so you may consider them instead (450 crowns).\r\n\r\nMy personal preference is Flygbussarna, which are quite comfy and have Internet onboard. I have yet to try the new shuttle service.\r\n	If you ever get to travel to Stockholm and land at Arlanda Airport here is the way you may get to city center.\r\n	getting-from-arlanda-airport-to-stockholm-city-center	travel	Getting from Arlanda Airport to Stockholm city center		If you ever get to travel to Stockholm and land at Arlanda Airport here is the way you may get to city center.\r\n		If you ever get to travel to Stockholm and land at Arlanda airport here is the way you may get to city center.\r\nIn fact, there are a few.

476	Afraid of driving?\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.097166-05	I don’t know about others, but I felt terrified when I started driving shortly after getting my driving license.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a step back, I can say that the uncomfortable feeling comes in large proportion from the peer pressure. Especially in the beginning when I didn’t quite have the skill yet of starting from the idle. I stalled quite often once the traffic lights changed to green and this created an additional anxiety during the driving.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this is almost past now.  I have now been driving for about 3 months, but not a on a regular basis, mostly on the weekends. What has helped me enormously was practising starting the car at a parking lot. As I mentioned, stalling was the most bothering part. I just went one day to a large parking space and started practising. I did it maybe for an hour. I then drove to a nearby store, about 5 km away and noticed a significant improvement. So if you are in a similar situation, try it! It will definitely ease your driving experience, if you are a newbie as myself.\r\n\r\nUsually, people feel profound fear anytime they start something completely new. Something of which they have no previous experience. Of course I have driven a car before. In fact, I took quite a lot of classes from professional teachers. But these two differ.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you have a different car. In my case it was a comfortable new car, which had all kinds of tools to help you. My own car is a very old Opel. And that is fine, since it’s my first one.\r\n\r\nSecond, the teacher is giving you instructions continuously. So, basically, you are not fully responsible of all of your actions. Or at least you feel this way. Another story is when you are alone in the car and something happens. What do you do? How do you proceed?\r\n\r\nI once had a situation (in fact, I had quite a few interesting ones) where I was driving across a tramway track. Suddenly I got confused about how to drive. When I was turning the traffic light was green, allowing me to pass. However, after I crossed the tramway the lights were red (now I realize they were red for pedestrians). And I stopped. The way I stopped was though a little bit strange, since half of my car was still on the tramway track :D So I stopped and froze. There are cars coming from the right and then there’s a tram coming as well! The tram started signalling like crazy. So I just drove quickly away, once I saw no oncoming cars. I did not panic, but I felt disturbed afterwards. I did analyze the situation again and do understand what I should have done. Were a teacher in my car at that point, surely he would have told me what to do. But then I probably wouldn’t pay that much attention to it either and wouldn’t remember the case and how to act.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wrote this blog post to share my experience and feelings of driving as a beginner, so that others who find it, wouldn’t feel lonely on this journey. I definitely did. It felt like I am the dumb one out.

477	Live up to your values\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.1152-05	I see it clearly now that the ultimate happiness lies in living to your true values. This may sound very corny and all. But what I actually mean is dropping all your inhibitions and fears and just living in the moment. It may seem hard, but once you take one step forward, it is such an eye-opener. And the fears and obstacles dissolve. And the best part is this feeling of fulfilment and peace inside that you get.\r\n\r\nI am writing this to remind myself of this any moment I forget about it. I hope you can learn from this too. I am not as clear on these ideas every day, unfortunately. It's like my mind is blinded by other superficial things and, of course, fear. But once you give in, the universe is blissful. It's just us who don't see it.\r\n\r\nI am writing this from a hotel room in Chicago where I happened to end up after my flight to San Francisco was cancelled. Even though the previous flight was long and tiring I feel extremely happy and peaceful. And just one day before in my own apartment I felt completely unmotivated and frustrated. Frustrated with things which weren't working for me. You see, I was doing some work and faced some challenging moments. Plus, it was raining the whole day and since I haven't got anything (read: all the planned things) done, this made me even more sad. Of course we are going to blame all the external circumstances for our unhappiness! I am guilty of this too! Even though logically I understand it's us who creates our states of mind.\r\n\r\nI may be hyped right now because I've got a very nice hotel room and it's a sunny lovely morning here in Chicago. Plus, my bed is just amazingly comfortable! Oh, it's mere heaven! I need to get this one for myself. I bet it's worth every penny.\r\n\r\nI will try to relate how I got in this state in the first place and why things worked out well for me, despite the delayed/cancelled flights and running around about catching leaving flights.\r\n\r\nI would guess the main reason I got where I am is thanks to having a purpose and forgetting/not focusing on unimportant things. I decided to focus on how to get our product (I work at a startup) out there and get it sold. In fact, I should say I decided to focus on how to make the product of any use to people. I now understand (after reading halway Dan Kennedy's book "63 Marketing Strategies") that we shouldn't be focusing at all on what we want the product to be. Instead, we should be focusing on what people want out of the product. This is such a simple idea, but you don't get it if you haven't done any marketing courses or haven't been in the area at least a bit (for the record, I am developing the product itself, a.k.a, coding it).\r\nNow, since I had a purpose, I lost this notion of "myself and what would happen if?" and started wondering what would be these people around me interested in? This got me talking to the girl right beside me on the plane. I actually did get some good points from her.\r\n\r\nYou see, each and every person has an extremely high value, it's just that I don't always remember of it. So each of them can enlighten you in one way or another, as long as you are open for it.\r\n\r\nAnd this started the whole process - I forgot about my inhibitions and felt at ease when speaking to people. This made me feel great! And as a result it wasn't hard to solve any problems, since I was looking positively at anything coming my way. In short, the points to take from this post are that we don't have to focus so much on ourselves, instead we must find a meaning in what we are doing and forget about all the small things that don't matter!

492	Getting to downtown LA	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	I will shortly tell you how of your ways of getting to downtown LA from Hermosa beach. I live right on Monterey Blvd here in Hermosa and it's just a few blocks away from the Strand.\r\n\r\nDespite of the fact that everyone trashes public transportation, I still haven't changed my opinion about it. Even though I've had to skip the bus ride today and take Uber after all. But that was just because I was in a hurry to get to Union Station. You see, I was meeting my best friend from Finland who happens to be at the same time with me in LA. What are odds, you would say. Nevertheless, the stars aligned that way for us.\r\n\r\nI am writing this in the beginning of July of 2015. The price for Uber ride from Hermosa to Union Station at 11 am was roughly 30 dollars. Which I thought was too much. But then again, I got a promotion code. In fact, anyone can get it for their first ride on Uber. Just google for promo code for Uber. It ranges from 20 to 30 dollars.\r\nIf you happen to have several credit/debit cards, you could register several accounts and use this trick each time for a new card. You would also have to create a new account on Uber for that.\r\n\r\nThe way back was way cheaper. I hopped on an express bus on the Flower & 7th. The exact bus was Commuter Express 438. It took only about 40-50 minutes and there I was back at Hermosa. The fare, though, was a little higher than on a regular bus - $2.50. The express bus, apparently, runs only in the early mornings and couple of hours in the evenings, when people get off from work.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is, give it a try! It's definitely more economical, environmentally friendly and cheaper way to travel than a taxi/Uber/Lyft/own car/whatever car way!\r\n	I will shortly tell you how of your ways of getting to downtown LA from H\r\n	getting-to-downtown-la	travel	Getting to downtown LA		I will shortly tell you how of your ways of getting to downtown LA from H\r\n		I will shortly tell you how of your ways of getting to downtown LA from Hermosa beach.

485	San Francisco - Monterey - San Diego route	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	We've decided to drive to San Diego from San Francisco instead of flying. First, it's cheaper. Second, the views are priceless. According to the rumours. We are staying in Monterey at a small motel now for the night. The town is cozy and the Fisherman's wharf is definitely worth visiting: a lot of lights, delicious aromas coming from the fish restaurants and a lively atmosphere. Even though I didn't order anything, I got quite a pleasure from merely smelling all those tasty crab and ocean fish dishes. In fact, quite a few of the restaurants offer for tasting their chowders and you can, probably, get full by just tasting them one by one (evil, I know ;) ).\r\n\r\nWe left San Francisco before the end of the working day - at 3.30 pm. Took quite some time to get out to the highway. The parking fee, by the way, was extremely high ($18!) for 2 hours parking in the city center. Although it may be that the parking was allowed for the whole day. Not sure.\r\n\r\nI think that every single person on the Earth should visit California at least once in their lifetime! You must not miss this beauty! Along the way, we saw strawberry plantations. And also that kiwi, artichokes and avocados were sold by the farmers. I guess kiwi grows in Cali! You learn new things every single day :D\r\n\r\nOn the way I was savouring Californian pitoresque hills and the Pacific with its huuuge waves. I even saw a real (!) surfer on one of our stops.\r\n\r\nWe have also passed Santa Cruiz, which seemed like a beach town and according to people, surfers' paradise. Would have loved to walk by its lovely waterfront, but the place was so packed with cars we found no place to park.\r\n\r\nTomorrow we are heading to San Diego, which is another wonderful place. I have yet to discover it. Truly looking forward to it.\r\n	We've decided to drive to San Diego from San Francisco instead of flying. First, it's cheaper.

I even saw a real (!) surfer on one of our stops.\r\n\r\nWe have also passed Santa Cruiz, which seemed like a beach town and according to people, surfers' paradise. Would have loved to walk by its lovely waterfront, but the place was so packed with cars we found no place to park.\r\n\r\nTomorrow we are heading to San Diego, which is another wonderful place. I have yet to discover it. Truly looking forward to it.\r\n	
495	Some Things to do in LA	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	I will describe briefly what I've seen in LA and what I thought was worth our time and what not.\r\n\r\nThe Getty Center\r\n\r\nThis place is an absolute must-see, whether you are into arts or not. It has a lot more to offer than just a regular museum. In fact, we didn't even manage to see it all. Unfortunately. In short, out of all things I've seen in LA during my 10 days stay, I would put this on the top of my list. Well, of course, besides the beaches.\r\n\r\nThe place is maintained really well. It's very neat and the white edifices look terrific. Especially in the Californian sun. These are complemented by an amazing garden, designed by Irwin. I suggest you take a tour of it. Our garden tour guide was very joyful and that made the experience that much more delightful.\r\n\r\nAnother tour that is definitely worth seeing is about the era of Impressionism. The Getty Center has an amazing collection of famous painters such as Monet, Goya, Van Gough (they have the "Irises" (!), which used to be at some point the most expensive painting out there). I, personally, always try to join a tour when in a museum. That way you learn so much more about the works. It's also very interactive, so you get to ask things you may want the guide to elaborate on.\r\n\r\nThey have couple of terraces outside too, where you may enjoy your coffee with a muffin or a brownie. Oh yes, they also have free WiFi, which is a big deal if you are a traveller like me and you need to check next bus schedules.\r\n\r\nBesides these two tours that I mentioned (there are much more, actually!), they also present a movie which explains in general about the place and who was Getty. Worth seeing it, if you want to know a little more about the history of the center. It's also merely 10 minutes of sitting in a comfy chair.\r\nOverall rating: 5\r\n\r\nSanta Monica\r\n\r\nAnother wonderful place you want to visit while in LA. I've heard a lot about it and I was a little bit disappointed the first time I saw it. There are literally thousands of people on this beach. It's super crowded. Or maybe that's because it was a Sunday.\r\n\r\nGrab yourself an ice cream (I took two scoops with a waffle for $6.25 - the portion was HUGE and it starts melting quickly) on the pier and watch people dancing, singing, swimming and having fun. Perhaps the most interesting part here is watching acrobatics. There are tons of people showing their skills. It must be so fun to show your achievements. So much better than just plainly training in an under-the-roof gym.\r\nYou are truly an artist, if you do acrobatics. It's inspiring for the public to watch you and very rewarding for oneself.\r\n\r\nBesides the wonderful and VERY large sandy beach, there is Santa Monica Place, which is basically a mall. It's very close to the beach and you can also dine here. However, I wouldn't personally recommend it. I would instead find some restaurant/café around the area. The food court was a little too fast-foody, if you know what I mean. The price/quality ratio is definitely on the lower side. I loved the burrito with scrambled eggs, lots of veggies and mildly spicy salsa we had the other day in an authentically looking Mexican restaurant.\r\n\r\nIf you don't find anything interesting at the Santa Monica Place, head to the Broadway walk street. Oh, that one is wonderful! There are a lot of shops, fountains with amusing made of grass sculptures and, surely, lots of people.\r\n\r\nI've also heard that Santa Monica is another place (besides Beverly Hills, of course) where you can meet celebrities sipping their coffee on a terrace. We haven't met anyone, but then again I don't know almost any Hollywood stars.\r\n\r\nAnd another plus, Santa Monica has a farmers market open on Sundays!\r\n\r\narkets\r\n\r\nI love that the US has the concept of farmers markets. Back in my home country that's a big thing, but not in Finland, sadly. There are surely markets in Finland which sell, presumably, good and healthy food, but they are way too pricey.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles has at least one market place open from the morning till early afternoon in one of its areas. That way you can get fresh produce basically every day. Some of the tables offer samples, so you may taste sweet and flavoury fruits ripened on the Californian sun.\r\n\r\nPrices vary from one market to another. For instance, we found the Grand Central Market to be very cheap, while the Torrance one to be a little bit on a pricier side - in Torrance for a pound of peaches you would pay 3 bucks, while in the downtown just one dollar. But then again, there are is no sampling in the Grand Central and the overall experience isn't as nice. Besides, there was much more choice in Torrance.\r\ny own rating: 5\r\nWould definitely go again.\r\n\r\nBeverly Hills and Rodeo Drive\r\n\r\nI am really fond of this place. Even if I haven't bought a single thing. Well, except a lunch.\r\nWe started walking from  South Rodeo Drive. The street is cozy and inviting and you can enjoy houses and their designs, as well as expensive cars parked right next to them. Despite my expectations, I haven't seen any overly pompous or tasteless buildings. That's at least what you can encounter in Moldova. Rich people usually erect real castles there. Perhaps to show their greatness.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of famous shops and not just on Rodeo Drive, but on the close by streets too. Some of the restaurants are really fancy looking, but the prices didn't scare me. I thought that they were just regular restaurant prices. We sat at a patio facing the Beverly Drive and had a soup. Place's name was Nate'n Al Delicatessen. It was all right. We passed by the other coffee shops and restaurants and quite some of them were full. Like the Cheesecake factory had even a line of people waiting to be seated.\r\n\r\nMy own rating: 5\r\nWould definitely go again.\r\n\r\nGriffith Observatory\r\n\r\nWe travelled to Griffith Park and Griffith Observatory by public transportation. As well as for the other attractions. There is a Dash Observatory shuttle that takes you there from Vermont/Sunset station.  However, as it seems the shuttle runs only on the weekends. And we went for a visit on Friday. A lady driving a Dash bus told us that. She also took us to Los Feliz, which is just a little closer to the Observatory.\r\n\r\nWe walked from there on to the Observatory. It was quite an adventure. The road to the observatory is impressive. I was especially impressed by gigantic trees with massive roots. I felt like I was in Harry Potter's movie. We then decided to take a shortcut and went through the park to the observatory. Apparently, we chose an non-official path and it was a little bit of a challenge to get through all the bushes and obstacles. We even had to climb over a fence. However, we were rewarded by wild nature scenes and spotting foxes (or were they wolves?).\r\n\r\nThe observatory's architecture is quite impressive. Apparently, it was recently renovated and you can see a movie about it in one of the halls. I never knew, but apparently the place appeared also in many Hollywood movies.\r\n\r\nI would recommend going to the observatory a little later in the afternoon, because the access to the telescope opens at 7 pm. Which is the main attraction of the place. And a look through the telescope, according to Griffith J. Griffith, could be life-changing. He said that if everyone would look in the telescope and see what he saw, that would change the world.\r\ny own rating: 4\r\nWould go again, but after 7 pm.\r\n\r\nGrand Central Market\r\n\r\nA compact market with a dozen of restaurants - from Mexican fast food to nicer cafés. Definitely worth a try if you are into eating in a busy place with lots of things going around you. You may also buy fruits and veggies very cheap here. We've got a box of blueberries and cherries for just 3 bucks. They also have cheap ripe bananas, but just couldn't get them, because we were on our way to Hollywood. If you want a more quiet place to eat, there's a street right at the market with tables where you can take your food and enjoy on an LA street while munching on your food.\r\ny own rating: 4\r\nWould definitely go again. To get more fruits.\r\n\r\nOlvera street\r\n\r\nYou may pass by this colorful historic street if you are in the area. During the day at least there is a market with Mexican souvenirs and delicacies. There are also a couple of Mexican restaurants, which you may want to visit if you are into this type of cuisine. We just got ourselves a small sweet treat from here: a coconut sugary candy. It was very sweet, so be prepared to have some water to drink right after :D\r\ny own rating: 4\r\n\r\nHollywood\r\n\r\nI would say this is a must see place even if you are not into movies. At least I am not, but found it quite an experience. The Hall of Fame is reaaaally long! And there are stars which still have no name.\r\nWalk on the Hollywood Blvd till the Dolby Theater and you'll get to see "Marlyn Monroe's", "Samuel El Jackson" and other heroes and heroines! Obviously, they will most probably ask you for a tip if you want to take a photo with them!\r\nWe sat in a bar while eating our vegetarian burrito and enjoying the views of the Hollywood boulevard with fancy cars and people strolling along the street. It was a sunset and the buildings and the streets looked particularly festive.\r\nOh yes, try some ice cream in Hollywood. I've tried Ghirardelli, which right across the Dolby Theatre, as well as a small shop inside the theatre where they finish the ice cream in front of you - they take the chosen ice cream type, add all the ingredients (oreo, nuts, peanut butter, caramel, whatever you chose) and knead it all together. By the way, the portions in the US are way larger than in Europe. So you may want to split it with someone. We did it all the time.\r\ny own rating: 5\r\nWould definitely go again.\r\n	Read this if you want to get briefed on the main attractions in LA\r\n	some-things-to-do-in-la	travel	Some Things to do in LA		Read this if you want to get briefed on the main attractions in LA\r\n		I will describe briefly what I've seen in LA and what I thought was worth our time and what not.\r\n\r\nThe Getty Center\r\n\r\nThis place is an absolute must-see, whether you are into arts or not.

493	Why I cancelled my car rental in LA	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	People around me keep repeating that you cannot manage in LA without a car. I want to prove them wrong. Because they are.\r\n\r\nFirst off, you guys have a drought for 4 years! So maybe you should give public transportation a try sometime.\r\n\r\nSecond, some of the buses are quite nice and have air conditioning. Of course, I've also been to some that had quite a shady looking public, but in the end no one even told me a word on the bus.\r\n\r\nThird, it seems that for a tourist who has no idea about parking and extra fees in the city, it's just plain easier to take a bus. Renting a car is also about getting out of your comfort zone, in some ways, too. Sure. However, sometimes challenging yourself all the time, blinds you too.\r\n\r\nAnother option that Angelinos suggest is getting an Uber. I've taken one once. But that's NOT cheap and unnecessary. After all, we are on a vacation, there's no great hurry. We have time for travelling. When you are a passenger, you can also see more.\r\n\r\nRiding a metro/bus/express bus/you name it is also much less stressful. Even though this may seem counterintuitive to some. Both for an European who is used to manual box, European driving rules and has half a year experience of driving, that's definitely true.\r\n\r\nIn fact, being influenced by others and due to my own nature of challenging myself, I've booked a nice compact car. The price wasn't high at all. For three full days of riding a car I would pay a little bit over 60 dollars. But then I would need insurance, which to my surprise is quite high ($11 per day). Almost the price of the rental itself. Plus, I need a GPS navigator. You see, I don't have 3G on my phone while here in Cali. I've used my own Finnish card for communication. I probably should have bought a local SIM card, but never got to it. So the price of rental went all the way up to 100 dollars. I wouldn't say that's crazy a lot, either, though.\r\n\r\nAmong the other reasons of cancelling a car: being stubborn and challenging myself of getting it done differently; reading articles on bad past experience of car rental; following my previous preferences of choosing public transport/walking over cars; staying fit by choosing alternatives to driving.\r\n\r\nThere's probably a lot more of what I could say, but those are the main points of why I dumped the idea of "freedom with driving".

486	Thousands oaks and day two of road trip\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.600726-05	Our next stop during the trip from San Francisco to San Diego was at Thousand Oaks. That's a city in Ventura County, if trusting Wikipedia. The place we are staying at is Quality Inn, quite cute and comfortable place with a swimming pool under the sky and beautiful palm trees. They even have a gym with which they cooperate. It's about 10 minute walk from the hotel. But it's really fancy: with a cardio cinema (first time see such a thing!), stretching room with foam rollers, that I've tried here for the first time, lots of cardio equipment and a proper swimming pool. Instead of 10 minutes, it took me 40 minutes to find it, though. For the lack of proper instructions from the guy at the front desk. I gave them feedback when I got back from the gym. I definitely wish people would provide more feedback to each other. I try to remember this myself. Otherwise, the customer service was impeccable.\r\n\r\nOn the way from Monterey to Thousand Oaks we've stopped at several places. And I want to strongly emphasize that it's worth it taking the route next to the seaside (I believe it's called Pacific Highway) instead of taking inner land roads. Otherwise you'll miss a million unforgettable views of the ocean, green and flowery hills and, most importantly, of the sea elephants (those were huge and so simpatico :D ).\r\n\r\nWe've stopped several times. The cafes may not be the cheapest, but I guess that's a general practice on the roads. I've paid for one hot tea over 3 dollars at the Big Sur. Also, here you must say that you want a hot tea, not just tea. If you are unfamiliar, Americans also like and drink ice tea.\r\n\r\nThe other stop was  at the Ragged Point. We got to enjoy a live concert of what I believe was country music. They have a great view point and a nice large terrace with lots of tables. I've got myself hot sizzling grilled corn and tasty beans. That was my vegetarian option. For just three sides you pay 5 bucks. I found the food delicious.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the trip we got quite tired. However, the swim in the sunset at the pool was so refreshing! And finally I can feel warm by wearing just a T shirt and my jean shorts. I love California!\r\n	Our next stop during the trip from San Francisco to San Diego was at Thousand Oaks.

500	Test questions at YKI	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Test organizators didn't let me take a test paper with questions home. Anyhow, below is the summary of questions that I remember.\r\n\r\nTekstin ymmärtäminen was 1 hour long and had 6 tasks in it. First 2-3 texts were short and simple to understand. You had to answer to some questions related to the texts. They were multiple choice questions.\r\n\r\nNext followed a little bit longer texts, also multiple choice. Their level of difficulty was slightly higher.\r\nFor the last few texts you had to actually write the answer. These were also relatively simple, since you could just copy the answer directly from the text.\r\nOverall I would say that this part was probably the simplest from the whole test. I was unsure only about one answer. The text talked about a person, who has been known of having a strong character, serving in army and then switching to police after come back. After police service, he became a taxi driver, but not for long and apparently (if I understood correctly), started his own taxi driving business. The question that I am still unsure about hasn't been answered in the text directly, but you had to sort of realize the answer on your own. However, some of the words/expressions used in this particular part were unknown to me, so I am not absolutely sure that my understanding was right. Anyway, as they themselves say, better answer something than nothing. At least you have a chance to guess. You won't get any minus points for guessing. If the guess is wrong you won't get a point, but nothing will be subtracted from the total sum of points,\r\n\r\nNext part - kirjoittaminen - consisted of 3 texts to write. First was writing an email to your teacher saying you cannot come to the lesson. You had to say the reason you cannot come, how you are going to study for the missed lesson and then ask another (you had to come up with this one yourself) question from the teacher. They also reminded in all of these texts that you shouldn't forget about introduction and closing words.\r\n\r\nSecond exercise in kirjoittaminen was again writing a sähköposti (email), but this time to a center which verifies the cleanliness and hygiene of food industry. You were asked to imagine that you went to a restaurant and got a food poisoning after visiting it. You had to explain in the email the symptoms you felt; how you want the situation to be handled, so what do you want the center to do or verify there; provide your contact information.\r\n\r\nLast part was about writing a free-form essay on either of the subjects: "Everyone is in such a hurry nowadays" or "Buying from flee markets is worth it!". I chose the latter one. You had to imagine as if you are writing this to a Finnish forum, giving your own opinion on the subject. The test didn't specify how long it should be, but I wrote around 10-15 sentences.\r\n\r\nNext we switched to another classroom, called kielikeskus. They first explained to us what we have to do. By the way, the explanations are pretty clear, but if you have any questions, go ahead and ask.\r\n\r\nFirst questions from "puheen ymmärtäminen" were quite easy. You had yet again multiple choice questions. Each "speech" is repeated twice, by the way. So if you missed something first time, pay attention to what they say in the second repetition. By the way, you had a bit of time to read the questions before they asked you to listen. Hence, you may be more prepared and know what to listen for.\r\n\r\nProbably the hardest part of the whole test was "puheen ymmärtäminen" where you had to answer with your own words on the questions they asked. The person spoke really really quickly and even though it repeated twice, I had no time to really hear the terms they used so I could write them down in the answers. I had to come up with answers myself, based on what I understood.\r\nOverall there were probably 6-8 questions in this part of the test.\r\n\r\nLast part was "puhuminen" (speaking). You had to call a doctor and tell them what symptoms you have and make an appointment. Then you had to talk to your friend who invited you to the theatre and refuse politely her invitation. Then you had to also ask something from your neighbour. Lastly, you had to speak about a subject in a free form again. Among two choices of what to speak about were: "Technology has changed our lives" or  "What's the one device you couldn't live without". I chose the second one and mentioned my smartphone. There were specific points you had to talk about in your answer, such as why do you think this device is important to you.\r\nThe last two parts I remember vaguely, because they went really quickly and I had no time to really ponder on each question.\r\nLet's see what are the results. I honestly cannot say whether I passed or not. Will update you on this one once I know myself =)\r\n	Read about what they have asked on the test. Note though, that these come from my memory, so the list may not be complete ;)\r\n	test-questions-at-yki	learning-languages	Test questions at YKI		Read about what they have asked on the test.

507	Первые впечатления об Амстердаме	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Вот я и в Амстердаме - уютной и приветливой столице Нидерландов - точь-в-точь как моя подруга описывала ее. Мое временное место жительства находится в самом центре, в двух минутах от квартала Красных Фонарей. Говоря об этом, я пока еще туда не наведывалась, но собираюсь обязательно пройтись. Я видела пока только одним глазом как все выглядит - и то, случайно, набрела на него пока гуляла по другим улочкам. При входе сразу же обратила внимание на конную полицию, которая, как видимо, следит за порядком здесь. Я поняла, что вошла в "запретный" в других странах квартал, только по освещенным красным цветом окнам. Ну и конечно огромному количеству людей на улице. Хотя здесь везде толпы.\r\n\r\n<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/137605252@N07/22820732991/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0159"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/730/22820732991_350d401505_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="IMG_0159"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\r\n\r\nХостел, в котором я живу, называется Shelter City (Город приютов).

Также в хостеле есть сад, куда можно выйти и насладиться маленьким прудом с фонтанчиком. Здесь многие едят свой завтрак, который, кстати, входит в стоимость проживания.

Вы можете выбрать, что будете есть на завтрак из следующего: мюсли с йогуртом, к которым прилагается яблоко или банан, сэндвич с сыром и ветчиной или что-нибудь теплое приготовленное на кухне (например, одним утром девушки готовили французские тосты - french toasts). Я выбирала мюсли каждый раз - во-первых, не нужно ждать пока приготовят и ждать в очереди за этим самым теплым блюдом, во-вторых, порция достаточно большая, так что наедаешься. Также к завтраку можно выбрать один напиток: чай, обычный кофе или кофе приготовленный машиной (латте, капучино и тому подобное).\r\n	Читайте о моих первых впечатлениях об Амстердаме.	first-night-in-amsterdam	travel	First impressions about Amsterdam	Первые впечатления об Амстердаме	Read about my first impressions about Amsterdam\r\n	Читайте о моих первых впечатлениях об Амстердаме.	So I am in Amsterdam: a very cosy and inviting city  - just like my friend told me. I am staying in the center, which is just 2 minutes from the Red Light District. Talking about RLD, haven't seen it yet in all its "beauty", but planning to do a thorough tour ;D Had only a glimpse of it so far. First impressions: horse police right at the very entrance, and loads of people. I wouldn't have recognized it is RDL, if not for the bright red-fringed window parlours. The city is especially magical and romantic thanks to its small and light-reflecting canals.\r\n\r\n<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/137605252@N07/22820732991/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0159"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/730/22820732991_350d401505_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="IMG_0159"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\r\nThe hostel I am staying at is called Shelter City. It's pretty nice, except it's in a quite old building - which brings it its own zest. Windows are super tall, which I definitely love. They also have a lovely garden with a small pond. It was particularly easy to meditate there in the morning. I guess I've never meditated next to the water, where you can actually hear sounds of running water. Somehow the running water brings you to the present moment and it's almost effortless to be in the present. Or maybe it's thanks to my consistent practice of meditation for the last two weeks which made it easier.\r\n<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/137605252@N07/22809539785/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_0160"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5803/22809539785_fb13a407bc_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="IMG_0160"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\r\nIt's a Christian hostel and people working here are volunteers. How cool is that? By the way, I asked girls working at the café, and the hostel has been a hostel for over 40 years. Before that it was a school and the building turned 100 years this year.\r\n\r\nI may try some volunteering in future too. It seems like a fun thing: interacting with people, cooking breakfast for them and doing good stuff. People are very friendly, by the way.\r\nI thought the breakfast choice of a three options was really cool. You get to choose to have either a French toast (3 toasts, in fact) with jam and chocolate chips; muesli with yogurt and a fruit of choice or sandwich with cheese and ham. First of all, you do not overeat, as in case of a breakfast buffer. Second, you get a choice of healthier options. Plus, you can select to have a latte, cappuccino or tea to your meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more articles about wonderful Amsterdam ;)\r\n	Вот я и в Амстердаме - уютной и приветливой столице Нидерландов - точь-в-точь как моя подруга описывала ее.

508	Things to do in Amsterdam	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	When talking about Amsterdam, what first comes to many people's mind is Red Light District. Or cannabis. And indeed, one cannot ignore these.  If you walk in Nieuwmarkt area, where I got a chance to stay at a hostel, there's no chance you'll miss either of these - cannabis candies and confectionery is showcased on many small boutiques selling quite unusual things for a non-Dutch. On other streets, however, you'll see women's bodies showcased behind red-fringed parlours. To me this seemed and still seems so surreal that I still cannot fully comprehend it.\r\n\r\nBesides above two attractions, there are a number of other things worth doing in this cosy and unique place. First of all, just strolling on the canal street. This on its own is an experience. Lots of people own boats and some of them even live in them. A lot of them are decorated with home decorative plants, colorful lights and even mannequins.  One of the things I've definitely noticed, which differs from Finland, is the love for home plants and gardening here.  Lots of small gardens in front of the houses are full of flowers and diverse plants. This brings a unique feeling to the buildings - it makes them much more alive. Another wonderful feature of Amsterdam center architecture: huge tall windows. Through these a lot of inhabitants get to see the calm water flow on the canals and the boats passing by. Since there are so many canals, Ams center has lots of interesting bridges: from old to modern and artistic ones.\r\n\r\nNetherlands is known for its cheeses. Did you actually know that Gouda and Edam are not just names for cheeses, but for actual cities? Go to a market and try different types of Gouda: with herbs, chilli, other diverse spices, smoked, older and younger ones - they all have different flavours and are sooo good!\r\nThere are quite a few shops and markets in the center where you can taste, buy and get sealed packages of cheeses, which can fly with you back home in your hand baggage.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't rain all day long, take a bike tour in the city. You can see so much more on two wheels, than on feet. Bike rental prices are quite reasonable. In fact, Amsterdam is definitely a city with a lot of bikers. And, boy, do they move fast on the narrow streets. So care should be taken when walking on their lanes.\r\n\r\n	Read about places to visit and things to do in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\r\n	things-to-do-in-amsterdam	travel	Things to do in Amsterdam	Чем заняться в Амстердаме?

And, boy, do they move fast on the narrow streets. So care should be taken when walking on their lanes.\r\n\r\n	Наверное, первое что приходит в голову говоря об Амстердаме - это квартал Красных Фонарей. Ну или каннабис.\r\nНикто не спорит - эти вещи невозможно не заметить, находясь в центральной части Амстердама. Улицы усыпаны кофишопами и маленькими бутиками, предлагающими всевозможные сладости и изделия из марихуаны. На других улочках, женские тела выставлены на показ, что еще более шокирующее. На самом деле, для меня это все выглядело настолько невероятным, что я до сих пор не могу представить, что это происходить наяву - девушки впускают в свои "гостиные" абсолютно незнакомых и часто тошнотворных дядек. О том что происходит дальше, я даже не хочу задумываться.\r\n\r\nКроме выше-описанных экзотических развлечений, есть и другие вещи, которыми можно заняться в этом уютном и уникальном городе. Во-первых, прогулки по улицам. Почти все центральные улочки и улицы пересекаются с каналами. У многих жителей - свои лодки и катера, а некоторые даже живут в них. Голландцы частенько украшают свои лодки разнообразными живыми растениями, разноцветными огнями и даже манекенами. А вообще в Амстердаме заметно то, насколько его жители любят и ценят цветы и растительность. Улицы и дома усеяны различными цветами и декоративными посадками. Они делают здания более живописными. Другая характерная черта центра города - огромные высоченные окна. Через них, жители могут наблюдать за спокойным течением воды в каналах, а также за неспешно проплывающими лодочками. Другая отличительная черта Амстердама - симпатичные и уникальные мостики и мосты. Каждый из них носит свой характер - одни выполнены в старинном стиле, другие в ар-нуво.\r\n\r\nГолландия, несомненно, знаменита своими сырами. А знали ли вы, что гауда и эдам - не только сыры, но и города в Голландии?!\r\nПока в Голландии, сходите на рынок, ну или зайдите в один из многочисленных магазинов сыров, и попробуйте разнообразные виды гауды. В сыр добавляют различные специи, травки и даже колбаски. Также сыры различаются по тому, насколько долго они "созревали". Есть молодые, а есть и более насыщенные вкусом сыры. Купленный сыр могут упаковать, так чтобы не было проблем при его перевозки даже в кабине самолета.\r\n\r\nЕсли на улице не ливень, стоит взять на прокат велосипеды! Это верный способ увидеть намного больше, чем на своих двух. Цены - довольно разумные. А вообще, Амстердам - город велосипедистов. Пешеходы еле успевают избежать столкновения с мимолетными двухколесниками. И это характерно, многим городам Западной и Северной Европы.
467	Less is more\r	2015-12-01 04:41:23.87192-05	I yet have to learn this and transform it into a value. Because this becomes apparent, once you try it.\r\nThink about it: when you eat less, you start appreciating every bit of food you are eating, every crumble that is left on the plate. As a result, you enjoy the meal more than if you would have unlimited amount of it. This teaches one being grateful and ultimately makes one happier. It's not me who figured this out, but I have applied it and it does work.\r\nYou also get an additional boost of pleasure from exercising your self-discipline.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this concept is easy to forget, if it's not developed into a habit. I came upon it again when reading "The 4-hour work week" book. Tim has a whole section devoted to elimination of unnecessary tasks. And I've heard this many times from other people, whom I trust. The idea is to focus on the most important tasks and just ignore anything that wouldn't bring considerable benefit to your life.\r\n\r\nThe concept of less is more applies to quite a few aspects of our life: work, social life, material things and even physical exercises. We think that if we sit at the computer "working" for 12 hours, that should make us a great employee. However, how many of those hours were spent effectively? How many brought the results?\r\n Those who are obsessed with efficiency forget sometimes that all the time doing something doesn't always bring them to the results they might have wanted.\r\n\r\n I am writing this as a reminder to myself too, because I seem to forget of this. And it is quite understandable, when such ideas are promoted widely in our society.\r\n	Those who are obsessed with efficiency forget sometimes that all the time doing something doesn't always bring them to the results they might have wanted.\r	less-is-more	personal-development	Less is more\r	\N	Those who are obsessed with efficiency forget sometimes that all the time doing something doesn't always bring them to the results they might have wanted.\r	\N	I yet have to learn this and transform it into a value.

I came upon it again when reading "The 4-hour work week" book. Tim has a whole section devoted to elimination of unnecessary tasks. And I've heard this many times from other people, whom I trust. The idea is to focus on the most important tasks and just ignore anything that wouldn't bring considerable benefit to your life.\r\n\r\nThe concept of less is more applies to quite a few aspects of our life: work, social life, material things and even physical exercises. We think that if we sit at the computer "working" for 12 hours, that should make us a great employee. However, how many of those hours were spent effectively? How many brought the results?\r\n Those who are obsessed with efficiency forget sometimes that all the time doing something doesn't always bring them to the results they might have wanted.\r\n\r\n I am writing this as a reminder to myself too, because I seem to forget of this. And it is quite understandable, when such ideas are promoted widely in our society.\r\n	\N
468	Negotiating a deal\r	2015-12-01 04:41:23.979666-05	There are a surprising amount of meetups in Stockholm! Or at least relative to the number of events organized in Helsinki. I caught one that sounded very exciting and motivating to me: How to negotiate a deal. Even though it was meant for entrepreneurs, this topic, I think, is relevant to every single one of us.\r\n\r\nHere I will bring a short summary of the most valuable points to take, in my humble opinion.\r\nGetting away from the topic a bit, I must say that the speakers weren't perfect (e.g., typos in the presentation), but nevertheless, worth of my time. I had, by the way, to pay for the event.\r\n\r\nFirst point to take is that negotiating a deal is a win-win for both of the sides. So don't ever feel bad for trying to get a discount or other benefits - after all, both of you will benefit after the deal is sealed. The seller will get to sell his product, while you will get your desired item, as well as a small bonus on top of it. In fact, if the seller is smart, he will gladly accept the offer, because the deal will most likely bring the customer back.\r\nSo next time you are in a shop, just ask for a discount! This can be both fun and useful.\r\nIn case the shop person isn't willing to give in easily, ask them in a polite way if they are sure about it.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect is that you have to be clear about what you want. And you need to be confident about it. After all, even if you aren't sure about your wishes, how could they offer you that? So have a clear image of what you want and why you want it.\r\n\r\nAnother great idea that was brought up in the discussion about negotation is the energy. And I believe too this is a huge deal maker or breaker. If you have the right energy, you are most certainly to succeed - because you also become persistent and the chances of getting what you want grow immensely.\r\nTo get that rush of energy, visualize the outcome! Or apply any other techniques that work better for you - listen to some cool song, do 10 push-ups, etc.\r\n\r\nOne last important point I will mention, is related to negotiating a salary raise. The negotiation itself shouldn't ever come as a shock to the employer. You must prepare him or her for this. Otherwise, this won't work. So you could tell them about the future plans of how you are going to contribute to the company and mention that once you are done with those you would like to discuss your compensation.\r\n	Don't ever feel bad for trying to get a discount or any other benefits - after all, both of you will benefit after the deal is sealed.\r	negotiating-a-deal	personal-development	Negotiating a deal\r	\N	Don't ever feel bad for trying to get a discount or any other benefits - after all, both of you will benefit after the deal is sealed.\r	\N	There are a surprising amount of meetups in Stockholm!

481	San Francisco and Financial District	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	What is probably my biggest discovery during this trip is that you should be open to conversation with strangers. And you should literally feel at ease to be approachable. People feel it. They feel the energy you are sending.\r\n\r\nOf course, being initiative doesn't hurt either. That doesn't come naturally to all of us, though. At least not to me. Thus, I have to "pump" myself up in the morning, so that I am that state where I feel OK with being an extrovert.\r\nWhat definitely helps me is a quick morning cardio. And not some easy power walk, but something more intense. For example, a power walk wouldn't be effective, whereas a 10 minutes of kickboxing workout would definitely do it. While doing it, think empowering thoughts. What I think about is something like: "I can do it! I can conquer the world and create something of value! Well, others have done it. Why not me?".\r\n\r\nOur temporary office is at the RocketSpace on Bush St in the Financial District. It's a huge open space for startups. And it's very impressive. The views out of the window are breath-taking. I love skyscrapers. Maybe I would get used to them if I live in a similar city for a long time. But since we don't have them in Finland, I every time gasp at their grandeur.\r\n\r\nThere are many ideas coming into my mind while I walk the streets and I cannot remember them all now. I think I should get some kind of dictaphone. Or I mean I should find an app for it, to have a record of them all. In addition, when people give you feedback it would be great to record their opinions. Even though I am not sure how much of a privacy issues this would cause. For example, I could do a post about myself 10 years ago and each year down the road with photos and explanation about what I've achieved and what I've developed since. This would be interesting for myself, but also for others to see that great results come with time, as long as you moving forward one step at a time. Should definitely work on this one.

491	Los Angeles bus experience	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Just to give you a quick overview on Los Angeles public transportation. In fact, so far I've taken a bus to LAX and back. I stay at the cozy Hermosa beach for my vacation. I have rented a room here from AirBnB close to the beach.\r\n\r\ny mother was coming to LAX and I went to meet her. Despite my host's advice, I decided to give Los Angeles public transportation a try. There's bus 232 going from Long Beach to LAX transit center. To my surprise the bus was almost on time - just 3-4 minutes late.\r\n\r\nYou pay by cash in the bus. There's a special machine at the driver where you slide in the bills or coins. If you ever need to ride an LA bus, make sure you have the exact amount. The machine is greedy and won't return you any change :P Also make sure you slide each bill one by one. The machine is greedy, as earlier said, and will eat it up all at once. It won't count their sum, though. So slide in each separately. You won't get any ticket back either.\r\n\r\nThe experience overall was quite nice. The AC was working, some of the drivers are rather nice, and the upcoming stops are clearly shown on the monitors. I downloaded Google maps beforehand for offline use, so I could see during my whole trip where I am and where should I get off. Do that too. It will help you tons, if you ever get lost in LA while walking.\r\n\r\nI was positively surprised that the bus didn't take too long. And it arrived on time to my destination. To note, it was around 4-5 pm on the 3rd of July. Traffic wasn't bad at all. I guess the experience can be opposite in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe ride from LAX back, though, took a while. We just missed the bus and had to wait probably an hour for the next one. It was around 6.30 pm when we arrived at the bus stop. So if you value your time, think of other options.\r\n\r\nThe public in the bus are regular people, mostly with lower income, I would guess. Otherwise, there are quite some homeless people and drunkards. So that's the downside. Of course, only if you care about it.\r\n\r\nThe bus fare, though, is nothing, if you compare to a taxi. It's only $1.75 for adults and 35 cents for seniors in the evenings.\r\n	Just to give you a quick overview on Los Angeles public transportation. In fact, so far I've taken a bus to LAX and back.

498	Experiencing YKI test	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	It was actually both of us who took the test: me and my brother. Even though we've registered within first 3 minutes of the opening registration period (YES! I was sitting at 8 am sharp waiting nervously for registration to open in front of my PC), we still haven't got to take the test at the same time. I have no idea how they decide this. But nevertheless, we had the test at different times.\r\n\r\nOverall, I could say that the test difficulty varies considerably from one exercise to another. This is especially noticeable in the listening part (puheen ymmärtäminen). It's ridiculous how illogical this part is. The simpler exercises (those that come in the beginning) have much more time to think on (even overly too much, in my opinion), than the harder ones. I guess that's the purpose. But it still doesn't make sense to me.\r\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, the puheen ymmärtäminen was the hardest part. The puhuminen (speaking) was second hardest. And that's because I need some time to think about the cases (you know, is it akusaatiivi, partitiivi or genetiivi that I have to use in this situation). So in the end I have said something, but probably with tons of mistakes. I definitely wasn't prepared for such a fast pace. Oh well, we'll see the results when they come. According to the test center, it will take 2 months to verify them. The results will come by post.\r\n\r\nOh, by the way, we took the test at AmiEdu, which is in Helsinki. It's a nice center, modern looking and with good practices. Or I least I thought so. I wanted to mention this because someone else was saying that the puhuminen part was super annoying for that person when he was taking the test, because he could hear others speaking and it was very distractive. I could hear people speaking, but I really didn't hear what exactly they were speaking. So it wasn't bothering me at all. I think that's because of their good headphones at their center. Oh yes, the test itself costs 100 euros.\r\n\r\nI was amazed at how some people can be so unprepared and undisciplined. But I guess that's how things are... There were several people who haven't taken a proper ID (which is passport or official ID with your image, NOT a driver's license!), some who haven't printed the receipt for the test, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnother funny thing that I noticed was that probably 75 percent of people who took the test were Russians. Which is definitely a good thing. It means that people actually want to learn the language and want to integrate. Also most of the people knew each other. As I understood they all took the preparatory courses for the test.\r\n\r\nOur test was organized on 29th of August, on a (!) Saturday. I would have never expected this. But maybe this is more practical for people who work.\r\n\r\nThe test is also rather long - up to 5 hours all in all. The ymmärtäminen part (reading comprehension) is the longest - 60 minutes. Next comes kirjoittaminen (writing). This is 55 minutes long. In between these two you have 15 minutes break.\r\nThen follows kielikeskus test. So you go to a different room with appropriate equipment for the test (headphones and other stuff needed for listening/speaking).\r\nThe listening part was a little longer than the speaking part. But overall these two were maybe an hour long.\r\n\r\nAs a tip I would recommend to take with you a sandwich or something small to eat in between tests. Because the test takes a good part of your day and mental activities require some energy. I took a salad and stored in the fridge, which they had at the center.\r\n\r\nIn the next post I will describe in more detail each part of the test.

472	Trip to majestic St. Petersburg	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Getting around\r\n\r\nOur temporary "home" was in a fancy district - right at Fontanka. Since this is the city center, pretty much everything we visited was within a walking distance. We haven't taken a metro or any other public transportation once. But we did order  Uber couple of times. The experience was rather good, no serious complaints. Except that some of the drivers weren't so eager to open the door for me (they did, however, to my fiance). One thing to note is heavy traffic in the city, so if being on time is a must, order the car earlier.\r\n\r\nPlaces worth to visit\r\n\r\nThe customer service is rather good, except for some objections. The waitresses greet you, speak politely and smile. I would guess that majority of them are students. They do, however, seem to forget the order and do not bring the change on time (which is rather odd and unusual for us). For instance, they took our credit card and returned it only after maybe 5 minutes. This was a decent place ("Schastie" coffee shop, or "Happiness" in English), otherwise, I would have thought that they are doing something fishy. In "Shocoladnitza" it took them quite some time to return our (quite significant) change. Otherwise, we enjoyed the food and even got some cooking inspiration and tips. Some of the cafes serve wonderful tea with berries, fruits and ginger. We thought we could do this on our own too: just boil the tea, add raspberries, lemon and pieces of ginger into a tea press. Then top it with some mint. In general, their drinks are fresh and diverse - a nice alternative if bored with water or regular tea. My personal recommendation is visiting some small cozy cafes instead of regular chain restaurants. We mostly went to recommended on Trip Advisor places and that proved to be rather successful.\r\n\r\nWhat regards the prices on eating out in St. Petersburg, they are cheaper than in Scandinavia. I guess that is to be expected. Note that our trip was in April 2015 and we mostly ate at cafes. We spent on average 15-20 euros per one visit - that included a soft drink, mineral water, a sandwich or pancakes and some small dessert for each of us two.\r\n\r\nShopping in the city was worth it too. We visited Galeria on Nevsky prospekt, next to Moskovsky vokzal. Galeria is a gigantic shopping mall with numerous boutiques and what I liked most was that they had much more to choose from and a lot more brands than what you find in Scandinavian countries. There were even couple of art boutiques, where you could shop for exclusive pieces. On a little less pleasant note, the mall didn't provide WiFi access. Internet would have been rather handy, because it got really late when we finished shopping and we would have wanted to grab Uber home. That brings me to another exciting aspect of living in St. Petersburg - a countless number of businesses run 24/7. We are not spoiled with such options here in Scandinavia. On the other hand, I felt quite bad for those ladies at the coffee shops, which looked rather tired after a long day at the counter. And, frankly, I do appreciate our life in Scandinavia where we get to do more in a day, than just work. I wouldn't deny, though, that it's pretty nice to pop in to your favorite cafe at midnight after hours of shopping.\r\n\r\nWe took also a free tour organized by a young Russian, who took us from Palace Square to some of the main attraction points. The tour was 2,5 hours and was rather informative. See, I think that just seeing places and not hearing their history is a bit less interesting. Plus, we were lucky with the weather - it was sunny and there was almost no wind. And that is, indeed, luck. According to staticstics, only every third day in April is sunny.\r\n\r\nWatching our guide conducting the tour made me wonder if I could become one myself. She was confident and her English was good. At the end of the tour we and others (we were a group of maybe 30 people) tipped her. Apparently, this is how free tour guides are rewarded.\r\n\r\nSpa and hotel\r\n\r\nThe hotel room we got in St. Petersburg became my top favorite for the whole trip! Besides the fact that we stayed right in the city center at Fontanka, we got a free upgrade to a lux! My fiance booked a fancy room, but the one we got exceeded all my expectations. The bathroom was huge, with a shower room and a luxurious bath tab with bronze faucet. That one I had only seen in movies where they showed glamorous divas taking a bath with a glass of champagne in their hand.\r\n\r\nFrom now on I will only ask for free upgrades to luxury suites, because they are so worth it! On a negative note, we thought that the breakfast was included in the price - because the hostess said just that when we checked in. That proved to be a mistake on our checkout. However, we were persistent and fought back. After all, we wouldn't have even considered eating breakfast in the hotel - it's much more fun trying out new cafes.\r\n\r\nThe hotel also had a spa and we decided to try out its services. Some say you got to love yourself and give your body treats and it will respond to it. My fiance got a back massage and I got a pedicure and a treatment for my chapped after a "March-bycicle-ride-in-Copenhagen" hands. My fiance was rather satisfied with massage, even though the masseur didn't speak any English. I also left quite happy, as the lady who was treating my hands and feet was pleasant and helpful. The pedicure was definitely worth it, but I think I might have skipped the hand treatment - it was priced almost at the same level as the pedicure.\r\n\r\nLanguage barrier\r\n\r\nI have no idea how do foreigners manage during their trips to Russia - you see, I am a Russian-speaking person. I would guess this is quite a challenge. Rarely do you find any names written with Latin letters -- never mind waitresses' English knowledge. I did, however, enjoy to the full the opportunity to express all my feelings and wishes while talking to personnel.\r\n\r\nRussian ballet\r\n\r\nRussia is famous for its ballet and we decided to take advantage of it. Mariinsky theater (the new stage) is an immense building with splendid design and walls of beige marble. The tickets were extremely expensive (around 100 euros per ticket), but the experience was to remember - that was, definitely, the best ballet performance I've seen so far. We went to "Le Corsair" and the hall was full with elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen. We did have a bite at the theater, but the experience was rather stressful - long queues, hassle everywhere, as you need to get your food, eat it and get to your place before the third bell.\r\n\r\nTravelling from Helsinki\r\n\r\nWe started our trip from Helsinki railway station early in the morning - at 6 am. We took Allegro express train and it was very affordable, because we took it so early. I would whole-heartedly recommend taking this train if travelling from Helsinki. First of all, it's very quick. I've been to St. Petersburg more than couple of times and never has been the road there a pleasant experience. Second of all, the border control is so much quicker and it's done while on you are travelling.

Here you will find also some tips and personal opinions about worth to visit places.\r\n		Getting around\r\n\r\nOur temporary "home" was in a fancy district - right at Fontanka. Since this is the city center, pretty much everything we visited was within a walking distance. We haven't taken a metro or any other public transportation once. But we did order  Uber couple of times. The experience was rather good, no serious complaints. Except that some of the drivers weren't so eager to open the door for me (they did, however, to my fiance). One thing to note is heavy traffic in the city, so if being on time is a must, order the car earlier.\r\n\r\nPlaces worth to visit\r\n\r\nThe customer service is rather good, except for some objections. The waitresses greet you, speak politely and smile. I would guess that majority of them are students. They do, however, seem to forget the order and do not bring the change on time (which is rather odd and unusual for us). For instance, they took our credit card and returned it only after maybe 5 minutes. This was a decent place ("Schastie" coffee shop, or "Happiness" in English), otherwise, I would have thought that they are doing something fishy. In "Shocoladnitza" it took them quite some time to return our (quite significant) change. Otherwise, we enjoyed the food and even got some cooking inspiration and tips. Some of the cafes serve wonderful tea with berries, fruits and ginger. We thought we could do this on our own too: just boil the tea, add raspberries, lemon and pieces of ginger into a tea press. Then top it with some mint. In general, their drinks are fresh and diverse - a nice alternative if bored with water or regular tea. My personal recommendation is visiting some small cozy cafes instead of regular chain restaurants. We mostly went to recommended on Trip Advisor places and that proved to be rather successful.\r\n\r\nWhat regards the prices on eating out in St. Petersburg, they are cheaper than in Scandinavia. I guess that is to be expected. Note that our trip was in April 2015 and we mostly ate at cafes. We spent on average 15-20 euros per one visit - that included a soft drink, mineral water, a sandwich or pancakes and some small dessert for each of us two.\r\n\r\nShopping in the city was worth it too. We visited Galeria on Nevsky prospekt, next to Moskovsky vokzal. Galeria is a gigantic shopping mall with numerous boutiques and what I liked most was that they had much more to choose from and a lot more brands than what you find in Scandinavian countries. There were even couple of art boutiques, where you could shop for exclusive pieces. On a little less pleasant note, the mall didn't provide WiFi access. Internet would have been rather handy, because it got really late when we finished shopping and we would have wanted to grab Uber home. That brings me to another exciting aspect of living in St. Petersburg - a countless number of businesses run 24/7. We are not spoiled with such options here in Scandinavia. On the other hand, I felt quite bad for those ladies at the coffee shops, which looked rather tired after a long day at the counter. And, frankly, I do appreciate our life in Scandinavia where we get to do more in a day, than just work. I wouldn't deny, though, that it's pretty nice to pop in to your favorite cafe at midnight after hours of shopping.\r\n\r\nWe took also a free tour organized by a young Russian, who took us from Palace Square to some of the main attraction points. The tour was 2,5 hours and was rather informative. See, I think that just seeing places and not hearing their history is a bit less interesting. Plus, we were lucky with the weather - it was sunny and there was almost no wind. And that is, indeed, luck. According to staticstics, only every third day in April is sunny.\r\n\r\nWatching our guide conducting the tour made me wonder if I could become one myself. She was confident and her English was good. At the end of the tour we and others (we were a group of maybe 30 people) tipped her. Apparently, this is how free tour guides are rewarded.\r\n\r\nSpa and hotel\r\n\r\nThe hotel room we got in St. Petersburg became my top favorite for the whole trip! Besides the fact that we stayed right in the city center at Fontanka, we got a free upgrade to a lux! My fiance booked a fancy room, but the one we got exceeded all my expectations. The bathroom was huge, with a shower room and a luxurious bath tab with bronze faucet. That one I had only seen in movies where they showed glamorous divas taking a bath with a glass of champagne in their hand.\r\n\r\nFrom now on I will only ask for free upgrades to luxury suites, because they are so worth it! On a negative note, we thought that the breakfast was included in the price - because the hostess said just that when we checked in. That proved to be a mistake on our checkout. However, we were persistent and fought back. After all, we wouldn't have even considered eating breakfast in the hotel - it's much more fun trying out new cafes.\r\n\r\nThe hotel also had a spa and we decided to try out its services. Some say you got to love yourself and give your body treats and it will respond to it. My fiance got a back massage and I got a pedicure and a treatment for my chapped after a "March-bycicle-ride-in-Copenhagen" hands. My fiance was rather satisfied with massage, even though the masseur didn't speak any English. I also left quite happy, as the lady who was treating my hands and feet was pleasant and helpful. The pedicure was definitely worth it, but I think I might have skipped the hand treatment - it was priced almost at the same level as the pedicure.\r\n\r\nLanguage barrier\r\n\r\nI have no idea how do foreigners manage during their trips to Russia - you see, I am a Russian-speaking person. I would guess this is quite a challenge. Rarely do you find any names written with Latin letters -- never mind waitresses' English knowledge. I did, however, enjoy to the full the opportunity to express all my feelings and wishes while talking to personnel.\r\n\r\nRussian ballet\r\n\r\nRussia is famous for its ballet and we decided to take advantage of it. Mariinsky theater (the new stage) is an immense building with splendid design and walls of beige marble. The tickets were extremely expensive (around 100 euros per ticket), but the experience was to remember - that was, definitely, the best ballet performance I've seen so far. We went to "Le Corsair" and the hall was full with elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen. We did have a bite at the theater, but the experience was rather stressful - long queues, hassle everywhere, as you need to get your food, eat it and get to your place before the third bell.\r\n\r\nTravelling from Helsinki\r\n\r\nWe started our trip from Helsinki railway station early in the morning - at 6 am. We took Allegro express train and it was very affordable, because we took it so early. I would whole-heartedly recommend taking this train if travelling from Helsinki. First of all, it's very quick. I've been to St. Petersburg more than couple of times and never has been the road there a pleasant experience. Second of all, the border control is so much quicker and it's done while on you are travelling. Lastly, the train itself is modern, has WiFi and comfortable sits.\r\n	
482	Frisco and the fourth day of learning	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	The posts in the series of San Francisco will be a mix tips about travelling and personal development. That's because of what I do here: I learn from the experiences and environment, while at the same time enjoying the places around.\r\n\r\nShopping is a big part of people's interest when coming to America. And it makes complete sense, especially if you are coming from Finland - prices are lower, the choice is very large, and plus you get high quality customer service. That is not without exceptions, of course.\r\n\r\nOn my late evening walk yesterday to Union Square I've stumbled upon Uniqlo shop (in fact, I had to ask what is the shop and its origins from a girl working there, since they have hieroglyphs in their name). I've never been to it before and it seemed to have a different style of clothes. By the way, I am not getting paid to talk about this, if you wonder. But among the positive sides of the shop I could say that they do hem your jeans or pants, if needed. That was, in fact, my first question when I came in. I was looking for jeans which would fit my height and I wouldn't have to fold them. I didn't find the jeans, but I got a sleek blouse and an interesting looking striped shirt. Both on an offer. The reason I haven't got the jeans was because the shop was closing. In fact, what I found out later was that the moment I stepped into the shop, it was already past the opening time. Apparently, sometimes the shops are open past their official hours. Even though I was the only customer in the shop (to my amazement, I didn't even hear any announcements about the shop closing), they let me try the clothes and purchase them. I think this is a general practice in most of the shops and not just this one. But I was still nicely surprised. They do know how to market and sell their stuff.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've noticed about myself, though, is that having a lot of clothes rips off from you a part of your attention and focus. For example, today I had a hard time choosing what should I put on me, since I have so many choices. And neither of the choices doesn't seem to satisfy enough, so I keep jumping to the other ones. I knew about it, but I seem to forget about it from times to times. So no more shirts, blouses, etc. Just strictly necessary set of clothes I really like and feel confident in.\r\n\r\nWe (me and my colleague's family) drove to the other side Golden Gate Bridge - Sausalito. What a breath-taking view! I really feel sorry for people who will never see San Francisco in their lifetime or even USA, in general. A must see, no doubts!\r\n	Shopping is a big part of people's interest when coming to America.

480	San Francisco and visit to Fisherman's wharf	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Today's day was probably the only free day we'll have in San Francisco. We'll be probably pretty busy with all the meetups we've scheduled to attend. Most of these we've found on eventbrite and meetup.com (I am not in any way affiliated with those).\r\n\r\nWe decided to the Fisherman's wharf, which a must-do thing (according to some) while in Frisco. We waited for the car for over (!) an hour. Yes, the line has been that long. Sigh. I probably wouldn't do it on my own, but we were with a family and kids. The ticket costs 6 dollars, no matter if you are an adult or a child. A little bit overpriced, in my opinion and I didn't get to see much either, since the place was packed with people. So not worth, in my humble opinion. The wharf, on the other hand, exceeded my expectations! Very lively, lots of folks around, together with lots of artists trying to sell their art. I especially liked how it smelled of crabs and cooked fish everywhere. So tasty!\r\n\r\nSan Francisco amazes me more and more, as I discover new streets. There are tons of unique cafes and small market places, with their own style. Very amusing to walk along the city streets and find new destinations. Perhaps, that's the most beautiful and unique city among those that I've seen. Well, no wonder. I guess it has it's fame for a reason. That's exactly why I would recommend not using public transportation, unless absolutely necessary, but instead walking to your destinations.\r\n\r\nFor those who are unaware of American retail chains for clothes: Marshalls and Ross are outlets where you could find famous brands for reduced prices. I've visited these today, but haven't bought much. But it's probably worth taking a look at things. I've bought quite some at Old Navy, though. The customer service there was pretty good, I must say. Felt really nice when people were helping me out, especially since I was so tired at the end of the day.\r\nOh, and even though the prices here are high, compared to the rest of the US, I still find some things that are cheaper than in Finland. For instance, a salad at Subway was just $5.50.\r\n	San Francisco amazes me more and more, as I discover new streets. There are tons of unique cafes and small market places, with their own style.

484	Feedback about your business/idea\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.563056-05	There are so many points I would still like to emphasize, which I didn't in the previous posts.\r\n\r\nWe get sometimes very straightforward feedback on our idea and implementation. Which I think is great, if delivered properly. Some people may sound a little offensive, but I guess that's how you feel when someone criticizes your work. On the other hand, I like much more negative feedback than positive one. I think in such an early stage we really need to learn from what are people saying. My another team member is quite attached to the product and sometimes it's quite challenging to discuss with her about any possible flaws. I don't mean that we fight. Not even close. But I can really see that it does affect her and she gets defensive.\r\n\r\nI wonder how do other teams solve this? I guess I am yet to find out.\r\n\r\nThe other night a marketing guy gave us again some honest feedback. And he was quite harsh. I wonder if middle aged men approach women in the same way as men when giving them their feedback on the product. Would love to see if it is. Sometimes I feel like they are teachers and I am a pupil, who haven't done her homework. That's definitely how I felt when talking to this guy.\r\n\r\nEven with all the negative sides, I think he did have a point. He asked how much testing of the business idea we've done. After my response, he said that that's definitely not what was needed. And I have to agree. Now that I am actually reading marketing books, I see that we are not doing enough research on the viability/profitability of the idea and solution. And even though I am more motivated to learn the technical aspects of the solution, in order to survive we would have to learn if what we are doing is what our customers want or need.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, we should go out there and test our idea on several families and see what they say about the product. Would they buy the product in future? I am yet to see if we are going to put this into practice, as I am not the only deciding party.\r\n	We get sometimes very straightforward feedback on our idea and implementation.

483	Palo Alto and Y Combinator's Michael Siebel\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.54215-05	Today was another day of learning and growth. We went to Palo Alto to participate in the Grind Silicon Valley meetup where Michael Siebel was sharing his experiences at and with startups. For those who are unfamiliar with Michael, he is the co-founder of Twitch, which was just recently sold. Moreover, he is a partner at Y Combinator - probably, the number one accelerator out there for tech companies.\r\n\r\nWe were pleasantly surprised by Michael's down-to-earthness. He was sincere in his talk and gave valuable tips. When the time came for questions (bragging spoiler!), I was the first to ask! My question was a continuation to Michael's point about MVP (minimum viable product). He said that most of the startups are killed by themselves. To elaborate on that, he said that 90% of the product is most probably wrong and maybe just 10% are right. And the founders may work on this "faulty" product for years without realizing anything.\r\n\r\nSo my question was what can we do to make our users provide us their honest feedback. His reply was extremely simple, but so unexpected to me. First, we should absolutely not ask what is it that the users want. That would change user's mode to founder's mode, according to Michael. Instead, we should ask what __sucks__ in our product!\r\n\r\nSecond tip, which also made complete sense, was about observing from the side user's interaction with the product. Can he see/understand/use its features. What does/doesn't make sense?\r\n\r\nWe later got to talk to Michael one on one. Which to me seems like a miracle! No wonder. I come from a different country. All these "stars" seem (khe, khe, seemed), to me completely unapproachable. Michael, however, was very pleasant. We quickly pitched to him and asked him how could we grow our business. He gave interesting ideas, which we may or may not implement. But it made me feel that we are at least one step closer to something real and attainable.\r\n	Today was another day of learning and growth.

478	Working on your pitch video\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.126646-05	We've been working lately on applying to several interesting accelerators. And, as expected, several of them want an introductory video about the founders. Thus, I would like to talk a little bit about what do they want from our video. There's a little bit controversy involved in it: first, it is suggested that we don't spend much time and effort into making of the video, but at they same time they prefer humour, personality and clarity. Most of them claim that it's better we invest time into the product, instead of the video. And this makes complete sense. However, no one will appreciate a crappy video either. So I guess there must be a balance there.\r\n\r\nI've watched couple of successful videos and they sent chills down my spine slightly - some of them have a traction of hundreds of thousands of users! Come on! Of course we cannot compete with these right now. I hope there is another criterion than traction based on which they accept startups.\r\n\r\nSo summarizing of what I've learned, the most important points are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>clarity - explain in simple words what you are doing</li>\r\n<li>conciseness - if the requirement is 1 min video, make it that! </li>\r\n<li>spontaneity - apparently, some learn the pitch so well, that it comes out of the mouth like some kind of learned by heart text. You must be enthusiastic about your work. Plus, be natural. Don't say any phrases that you do not believe in. It will show, unless you are a great artist.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe are going to record those videos today and I will write in the upcoming post how did the process go. And yes! We are going to Startup Grind Silicon Valley and Michael Siebel will be visiting. Let's see if we get a chance to talk to him. I definitely WILL do my best!\r\n	We've been working lately on applying to several interesting accelerators.

479	San Francisco and startups\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.139976-05	San Francisco: day 1 / 20.06.2015\r\n\r\nIn the following series I will describe shortly what I've learned from each day of my travel to California - as an employee and a member of a small, but a very ambitious startup. I am also looking into founding my own business, so very grateful that I can learn from my current job for the future.\r\n\r\nWe visited Quantified Self exposition which took place at the Fort Manson center - I would call it, an exquisite place. As San Francisco, in general, is. Golden Gate Bridge is seen right outside the door of the building.\r\n\r\nWe talked to most of the exhibitors and, surprisingly, there was a considerate number of Finnish startups. In fact, we met people who sit accross our table at our startup village at GE Healthcare in Helsinki! One American company even to my higher surprise, mentioned that they hired some Finnish developers for their product.\r\n\r\nBut to summarize of what I've learned during this day: it's great to be out there and socialize with people. You never know to whom you may speak. On that note, just when crossing the Fort Manson park I met a guy who proved to be a founder and a CTO of a quite successful startup in San Francisco. It's amazing how this place is filled with people which you may not be used to encounter on a daily basis. That looks especially mind gobbling since the streets of downtown are full of homeless people. In none of the US cities that I've been to have I seen such a high number of bums. You almost never see this in Finland.\r\n\r\nI've discovered just very recently the power of being open to people and the enjoyment of communication with people around you. It can be very fulfilling. But if you want to have a business, you need to start talking to people. Otherwise, how are you going to learn what they want? And since you are trying to serve people and bring value to them, you must know what they need and want. The key is to forget about yourself and just serve people.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I've noticed is that there are a lot of small markets which sell organic and cruelty-free products. The butcher shops, in turn, advertise their humane ways of killing the animals. So it seems that the public here is aware of the environment and sustainability issues. Which is wonderful, because we try to promote healthy and balanced nutrition to Americans.\r\n\r\nAs an addition to the previous, I would like to mention some things that I thought opened my (not experienced as of yet) eyes:\r\n\r\n1. Startups that I've talked to first try to get traction and traffic to their service and will only then think about a strategy to monetize it. That's a bit different from how we are doing things. And I think others have a point there.\r\n\r\n2. One startup mentioned that they won't go into app development for Apple watches. According to them, it takes too much time and effort and they are not sure that their potential users will all use the watches anyway. Would our target group use Smart Watches though? Hm, maybe yes, maybe not.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I am amazed at the power of one's thoughts. Just today, the day after I've spent quite a lot of time thinking about what would people really want from our app, we've met a woman on the famous Cable car to Fisherman's wharf. In fact, she has started the talk. I told her we are in SF for work and that we are developing a meal planner. She immediately told us her opinion on what current apps are lacking. And I haven't even asked her for an opinion! How could you not believe in magic after this?!\r\n	I share my experiences of working in a startup and, specifically, my trip to the Bay Area and what I've learned from it.\r	san-francisco-and-startups	personal-development	San Francisco and startups\r	\N	I share my experiences of working in a startup and, specifically, my trip to the Bay Area and what I've learned from it.\r	\N	San Francisco: day 1 / 20.06.2015\r\n\r\nIn the following series I will describe shortly what I've learned from each day of my travel to California - as an employee and a member of a small, but a very ambitious startup.

496	Strength camp experience with Elliott Hulse\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.730129-05	I got a gift for my birthday couple of months ago which I just got to use. Frankly, I asked for it myself. I've followed Elliott over two years on YouTube. I think I've been hooked once I saw his video on child's education. Although I don't have kids, his ideas deeply resonated with my views. I kept watching his videos ever since.\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar with Elliott, he does videos on both strength training (weight lifting, muscle balance, etc.), but also on psychological strength and resilience and lots of other topics. Check him out if interested.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I went for a one day camp event. Elliott's tour included Europe too, Stockholm included. So I came here to experience it too. In fact, that was my first motivational/personal development seminar ever. Got to attend more. Would love if these would be organized more in Helsinki, Finland.\r\n\r\nAs I expected there were just a few women among attendants. Most of the people were in their early twenties who (seemingly, at least) lift weights on a regular basis. At some point I even felt a little bit uncomfortable, when we were doing some practical exercises. You see, I am quite miniature - 157 cm and 45 kg - and can be squeezed quite easily. So I had to move to the side to feel safer.\r\n\r\nThe whole seminar extended far beyond the planned time and included lots of motivational/educational material. Elliott first related his own story. Which in itself is motivational. It made us see that he's just another regular guy, who followed the principles and rules to getting where he is now - with over a million subscribers on YouTube and successful business. In fact, according to his school teachers, he is supposed to be a dump one.\r\n\r\nI will shortly summarize the main points that I thought were the most interesting and impactful in the long run from his workshop.\r\n\r\n1. Vision board: an important element to map all your goals and dreams. It makes things happen in your life.\r\nThat should cover 4 aspects of your life:\r\n\r\na) your vocation (job, business, your professional calling)\r\nb) mastery - how you see yourself being a master of what you are doing for the world\r\nc) health and fitness - how do you look and feel in your perfect body\r\nd) relationships - how do you see your family and the relationship with its members; friends and your friendship; relationship with your partner.\r\n\r\n2. Nail down your core values\r\nThese will help you figure out a little bit more about who you are and will be super helpful at deciding what you want to do in the future too. Plus, it will map a guideline of things you absolutely cannot step over. Those will be sacred.\r\n\r\n3. Learn and practice getting into your subconscious\r\nAccording to latest studies, only 4% of our behaviour is influenced by our conscious mind!! This is mind blowing :-O\r\nSo we'd better start working on getting our unconscious mind align with our core beliefs and personal goals. And that is, unfortunately, not always the case.\r\n\r\n4. Don't dream too small! That wasn't said by Elliott, but by one of his mentors.\r\n\r\n5. A technique which I thought must be super powerful, which Elliott personally used to getting his dreams to reality. It consists of following steps:\r\na. remember a moment in your life when you were at the top of the world and play this movie in your head, imagining vividly how it has happened and re-experience it and feel it. Most importantly, you have to EMBODY it!! That is, use your body when re-experiencing the moment. This part is ESSENTIAL.\r\nb. anchor it (that may be screaming some powerful affirmation or exclaiming "I am excellent!")\r\nc. Once you are done with playing the powerful movie say following: "I am so happy and grateful for ...". Instead of ellipsis put in your dream or your goal. For example: "I am so happy and grateful for having this wonderful, light and spacey studio for ballet training in my home". This MUST be very specific. In fact, you cannot overdo with specifics.\r\nThis technique must be practices at least twice per day. You can do it hourly too, if you are burning to experience things fast! :D\r\n	I got a gift for my birthday couple of months ago which I just got to use. Frankly, I asked for it myself.

490	Advices on getting investment\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.644242-05	We had a chat yesterday with a great guy, who has had success in the past with his previous businesses. Very approachable and simphatetic person. We've talked for about an hour, but I will shortly summarize the main ideas only.\r\n\r\nI've asked how to approach other companies for potential cooperation if you are a small startup, who doesn't have yet any traction. He suggested making off a list with all of those companies and contacting them all. If you know people's names from these companies, look them up in LinkedIn. If you have any close connection to them, you may want to ask your connections to introduce these people to you. This increases largely your chances of getting in touch with these people.\r\n\r\nWhen talking to investors and asking for money show them that you may have potential cooperation with other companies who have agreed to work together with you. This doesn't have to be a binding agreement. It may be a simple letter of intent. In fact, we have such a letter already, but we didn't think it would actually matter to investors. So that was a spot on.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about high competition and market saturation, our friend mentioned that it's all about execution. And that resonates largely with my idea about a product. There are maybe hundreds of apps that do similar things to us, but if we can develop something of value and with a great user experience, we'll get traction. Users aren't stupid.\r\n\r\nOn another note, we've had a meeting with another person (from an investment fund) just one day before. The chemistry among us was slightly different. I felt like he is some kind of professor and we are students. I have to say that that's probably my fault. I shouldn't put people on a pedestal. Yes, he's maybe rich. Yes, he's maybe got experience. But so what? We are young and ambitions and full of energy. And the world (as well, as the success) are in our hands!\r\n	We had a chat yesterday with a great guy, who has had success in the past with his previous businesses.

489	A bunch of things you may want to know before travelling to the US or what's weird about Americans	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	A bunch of things you may want to know before travelling to the US or what's weird about Americans\r\n\r\nThis will be a quick review on what I found funny/different between Europeans and Americans. I will also give some tips that may help you or myself on your travel in the USA.\r\n\r\nThings worth knowing to save some money:\r\n\r\nUse water fountains\r\na lot of places (shops, parks, airports, even streets, etc.) have water fountains with drinkable water.\r\nI usually carry a small bottle with myself to refill it. You save money while promoting sustainable living.\r\n\r\nStock up on fruits\r\nCalifornia is the biggest fruit producer in the USA. If you are here, take advantage of it. Especially, if you are coming from Scandinavia, where there are no local fruits, except maybe apples. The fruits are delicious and fresh. As well as at a reasonable price. I always learn new fruit names while here. Like d'anjou pears :-0\r\nYou may also want to try cheaper grocery stores, than Whole Foods or Trader's Joe. Food4Less is a good one. Very affordable prices.\r\n\r\nGet a huge bowl of good stuff from Chipotle and split it\r\n\r\nThe portions in the US are way larger than in Europe. Seriously. I ask for all the ingredients, except for sour cream and the contents barely fit into an already large bowl. I also ask usually for salad base instead of rice. Besides a better option from the nutrition point of view, you also win in the price. Lettuce is more expensive than plain rice :P\r\nYou may either split your bowl with a friend/partner/whoever or just leave half for dinner. If you eat it all in one go, you'll probably have discomfort in your stomach. At least I do.\r\n\r\nFunny facts\r\n\r\nNo scissors in the rooms!\r\nHotel front desk wouldn't give you scissors if you ask them. Unless you use them right in front of you. I find this ridiculous. But that's the way it is. I asked why. Apparently, for security reasons, duh.\r\n\r\nHot vs cold\r\nAmericans drink ice tea, besides the hot tea. So when you order a tea, make sure you say you want a hot tea, if you want that one.\r\n\r\nTalk to anyone\r\nAmericans are open to small talk. Well, at least most of them are. They would often start a discussion on their own. But why not try it yourself? You may learn something or just cheer yourself up. That's definitely a new thing for me. In Finland people don't talk to each other. They think it means bothering others. That's not necessarily true. I feel excited every time I do it! Since such practice is widely accepted over here, might as well take advantage of it and have some fun ;)\r\n	This will be a quick review on what I found funny/different about Americans.

488	California food offers	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Our hotel in San Diego doesn't serve complimentary breakfast. But that's all right. The breakfast people eat here is usually made of bagels with cream cheese, omelette, bacon, waffles, orange juice, etc. And that's great if someone's stomach can digest these. Mine cannot, for sure.\r\nI like omelette and I really like toasted bagels with blueberries (bagels with blueberries, huh? yep, you can find these in California, at least) and, of course, waffles with Maple syrup. However, those don't seem to digest very well in my body. You see, I almost don't eat any fatty or proteins rich foods. Sometimes, in one day I would just fruits. Other days, fruits and veggies. Nothing else. So, sure thing, processed and fatty products don't get through my digestive system very quickly. In fact, sometimes I wouldn't sleep nights just because of that. But that is another whole story.\r\n\r\nSince there was no breakfast available, I found out how to get to a grocery store. And I found two quite close: Trader's Joe and Food4Less. Trader's was still closed by the time I passed it. Food4Less, apparently, opens at 5 am (freaks! we wouldn't even wish about this in Finland, where shops open 8-9 am earliest and close by 9 pm latest). I've got a 510 grams box with blueberries for just around $3,50! Wow! Was really happy about the deal and ate the whole box for my breakfast. Got to buy more next time I am there. Bought also some d'Anjou pears very cheap, as well as bananas. And the service was great too! People very polite and stuff. I wouldn't expect this in a cheap grocery store.\r\n\r\nAll I am trying to say is that there are advantages in any situation. And if you look closely enough at any challenge, you'll see that you may learn or benefit from it.\r\n\r\nFor lunch I've got myself a huge bowl of sofritas. Man, that stuff is good. I wish we would have so much diversity in Finland. The bowl was huge and very tasty. They've packed everything in there: lettuce, black beans, grilled peppers and onions, all kinds of salsas, sofritas (tofu stuff), guacamole, cheese and probably something more. All this beauty costed only around 7 dollars. I didn't take any sour cream or rice. But the portion was so huge, that now when it's 11 pm the food is still not digested in my stomach. Will have to be more careful with this next time. There's probably too much protein in it.\r\n\r\nTo be continued and updated with further experiences about food and restaurants in Cali ...\r\n	Our hotel in San Diego doesn't serve complimentary breakfast.

And if you look closely enough at any challenge, you'll see that you may learn or benefit from it.\r\n\r\nFor lunch I've got myself a huge bowl of sofritas. Man, that stuff is good. I wish we would have so much diversity in Finland. The bowl was huge and very tasty. They've packed everything in there: lettuce, black beans, grilled peppers and onions, all kinds of salsas, sofritas (tofu stuff), guacamole, cheese and probably something more. All this beauty costed only around 7 dollars. I didn't take any sour cream or rice. But the portion was so huge, that now when it's 11 pm the food is still not digested in my stomach. Will have to be more careful with this next time. There's probably too much protein in it.\r\n\r\nTo be continued and updated with further experiences about food and restaurants in Cali ...\r\n	
487	Road trip: Thousand Oaks to San Diego	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Today was our last day of road trip. We left Thousand Oaks around 10 am and came to San Diego around 6.30 pm. We've stopped several times on the way, to check out the beaches and get some food. There were tons of them on the way. Quite a lot of them with surfers taming the waves of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe views weren't as great as the previous day. We mostly passed by sandy beaches. First stop was at Santa Monica. And that was because it was Sunday and there was no free parking spaces left at any other beaches along the way. The beach seemed really crowded and very long. Wasn't the nicest or cleanest place to be either. There were couple of nice from the outside looking cafés inside the white wooden buildings. They looked quite elegant and inviting on a sunny afternoon. Apparently, you may meet celebrities in that same café while sipping your warm latte. Will check them out when coming back to LA next week and will let you know about the prices and if I've met anyone.\r\n\r\nThe next beach we went to was in Oceanside and it seemed cozy. There were couple of Birthday parties there as well. I've never thought about it, but apparently in Cali a lot of people celebrate their birthdays on the beach. And it makes perfect sense - you get to enjoy a piece of chocolate cake while savouring the view of the ocean. Besides, no need to pay any extra for restaurants. On the beach were we stopped there was also a historic house which was shot in the TopGun movie with Tom Cruise.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day we got to the Days Hotel San Diego Hotel Circle. This was a disappointment, as it's way worse in several regards when compared to our previous hotel in Thousand Oaks. Even though they share the number of stars. Oh well, apparently the stars don't play a significant role in the quality of the accommodation. There's no breakfast included and the rooms are by a level worse than in the previous hotel. Plus, there's no fancy gym or cozy courtyard. I felt a little bit sad about this, but I guess this is how things turn out once you are levelling down - from a great hotel to a less great one. You lose comfort to some degree, but you also get used to the situation quite quickly.\r\n\r\nOn the other topic, I've now decided to commit to a challenge while on my vacation in LA. I will jump into the ocean every single morning, no matter how cold is the water. Will also film every try. Already excited about it!\r\n	Today was our last day of road trip.

470	The power of asking\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.011712-05	Anyone interested in self-development and, in general, in life improvement might have heard of this topic. Nevertheless, it may not be as apparent if one hasn't actually tried it. Take me: I have heard of the concept probably for at least a year now. I haven't applied it though and it was floating somewhere in my brain database. I have started paying attention to this only after a situation which made me realize the real power of asking.\r\n\r\nSee my situation: I live in Finland on a student visa and have been living here for almost 7 years. However, I still don't have any permanent status, so by the time I am graduated from my Master's degree (I have also earned a Bachelor's here), I would have to show to the authorities the reason why I am still eligible to remain in the country.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I also speak and understand the Finnish language (and even Swedish now), so I am positive I could have passed the citizenship test. If that's not enough, I have started working in Finland 3 months after I came, as part-time, though.\r\n\r\ny friend's story is, however, a bit different. She's also not a citizen of EU and she has also graduated from a Finnish university. She has been in Finland for around 4 years, but she doesn't know the language almost at all. She's worked in Finland for around one year now. But get this: she has her permanent residence permit already for a year! As well as the social security benefits. I am actually really happy for her and it's great that she got those all sorted out. But there's a question here for me: how could she get all these before me, even though I have more reasons to earn all these? The answer is simple: she asked for it. While I was waiting for the "right moment", she put her thoughts into action. And I am not even sure she realizes this. She probably thinks this is how it should be: you go to your boss and just ask for the right paper, which will get you the right status. On the other hand, I used to analyse the situation very carefully, so that I wouldn't put anyone in an uncomfortable situation, while stepping on my own well-being.\r\n\r\nAnd even, if you get a no, so what? The answer will always be a no, if you never ask for it.\r\n	The worst case scenario of asking someone for something is getting a no. But so what?

473	Eastern Europe - Moldova, Chisinau	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Chisinau is the capital of probably the least known country in Europe - of Moldova. I come from here. And below are my thoughts and feelings about the city 7 years since I left.\r\n\r\nYou see your own country in a different light after you've lived away for some time. I haven't noticed that the country is hilly, that the city is comforting in the spring evenings with warm sunset and that people's faces have their own distinguishable features, different from any other country I have visited.\r\n\r\nI live most of my time in Finland and I rarely visit my own home country. Some things here disappoint and upset me. One of them is how people treat each other. People are not very fond of being polite or nice over here. That's noticeable once you visit places of day-to-day activities - shops, markets, clinics, and so on. You see, some of the public services are cheaper here than in the EU, so if I am here I try to use this to my advantage.\r\n\r\nAnother feature in people that upsets me is dodgyness. I probably take it for granted already, but people almost never lie or try to trick you in Finland. That is not the case in Moldova, unfortunately. A small example of this is a trolleybus conductor who sells to you an old ticket she picked up from a previous passenger.\r\n\r\nThere's no concept of respect for each other. When you stay in the queue for something, it is very likely someone will try to cut you in the line. It's like some kind of competition. I reckon this is in the culture. The more people you trick, the better. People aren't even ashamed of it. Of course this is a generalization and this doesn't apply to everyone.\r\n\r\nPeople are also less punctual in Moldova. I believe it's not as bad as in other countries in the south of Europe, but yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings worth doing\r\n\r\n\r\nI will list the things I usually do while visiting Chisinau. You may try these if you are ever here, because these are definitely cheaper than in most of the Europe.\r\n\r\nI always visit a dentist. I go to the municipal dental clinic on Negruzzi street. A tooth filling costs me around 10-15 euros. Note, I am writing this in April 2015.\r\n\r\nI always go to a hairdresser, to a lady my mom and aunt go to. The price is around 10 euros, but you probably may find cheaper. Another treat I always get myself is a pedicure. Again, we know another nice woman who does a good job. The pedicure is way cheaper than in Finland - around 7 euros only. The manicure is 2,50. That may sounds as a joke, but it's true.\r\n\r\nThis time I also went for a med spa to remove small papillomas on my neck. The procedure was quick, but rather painful. That's because I've decided to take no sedative. The doctor was polite and, in general, I am rather satisfied with the service. The papillomas were removed with the laser and the whole procedure costed me around 50 euros.\r\n\r\nSince I've just got my driving license and I've started driving a car, I thought I may use some extra help and hire a driving school teacher while here. After all it's way cheaper than in Finland. Although, I've got quite a lousy service. The two times I've hired him he was late and also took probably 4 breaks for smoking in 1,5 hours. That's why I thought I'll better off without his services and fired him. On the other hand, my mom had a completely different experience. She is on her way of getting a driving license now. So I guess it just me who was unlucky with the teacher. A driving lesson costs 10 euros, but the teaching language is limited to Romanian or Russian.\r\n\r\nCafes and restaurants are cheaper here too. But not very much. A pizza in Andy's pizza (a local chain of pizzerias) would cost you 3,5 euros. A placinta (a Moldovan traditional pie) with branza (Moldovan version of Feta cheese, but tastier, in my opinion) would cost you 1,75 euros. The portion is quite large though.\r\n\r\nDespite the challenges, not everyone wants and is ready to leave the country for a better future. After all, Moldova has some pleasant and heartwarming places and lots of wonderful vegetables and fruits in fall. That's what I definitely miss from my home.\r\n	Chisinau is the capital of probably the least known country in Europe - of Moldova. I come from here.

475	Quick start on Tastypie API framework for Django	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	This is a quick overview of how to implement application programming interfaces in your Django app.\r\nI must say that for me, personally, the experience of writing APIs using Tastypie proved to be more pleasant than I expected.

474	Setting up a new environment for Macintosh	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Installing a new development environment is usually a darn tedious task. I've been reminded of this just recently, when setting up my brand new Macintosh. I had to repeat yet another time the same procedure when I was travelling and took with me my own Mac. So here's the walk-through one may find useful too.\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL installation\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Mac, you should absolutely get to know Homebrew. It's a package manager on Macintosh, as is apt-get on Ubuntu.\r\nTo install postgres, run:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\nbrew install postgres\r\n</pre>\r\nYou will see suggestions about how to run postgres as a service and how to start it.\r\nHere are these again:\r\n\r\nTo have launchd start postgresql at login:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\nln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThen to load postgresql now:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plis\r\n</pre>\r\nPostgres files will be found from Cellar directory: /usr/local/Cellar/\r\n\r\nValentina Studio\r\n\r\nYou may have already heard of Valentina Studio. It's a database management tool. You can also use it to create reports.\r\nTo install, run:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\nbrew cask install valentina-studio\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you haven't heard of Homebrew-Cask, you may want to read on it. It allows you to install GUI applications in the Homebrew style.\r\n\r\nTo connect to your local database using Valentina Studio, enter in the user field your current username.\r\nBy default, there's no password created for the current user.\r\n\r\n\r\nRestore the database\r\n\r\nWe use Heroku for production and development. So I download the dump file from its dashboard and then run:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\npg_restore file.dump -d your_db_name\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf you do have keys already added to github, just clone the repo.\r\nIf not,\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate virtual environment\r\n\r\nVirtual environment is a must for any new project. I had to learn it the hard way.

I've been reminded of this just recently, when setting up my brand new Macintosh. I had to repeat yet another time the same procedure when I was travelling and took with me my own Mac. So here's the walk-through one may find useful too.\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL installation\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Mac, you should absolutely get to know Homebrew. It's a package manager on Macintosh, as is apt-get on Ubuntu.\r\nTo install postgres, run:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\nbrew install postgres\r\n</pre>\r\nYou will see suggestions about how to run postgres as a service and how to start it.\r\nHere are these again:\r\n\r\nTo have launchd start postgresql at login:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\nln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThen to load postgresql now:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plis\r\n</pre>\r\nPostgres files will be found from Cellar directory: /usr/local/Cellar/\r\n\r\nValentina Studio\r\n\r\nYou may have already heard of Valentina Studio. It's a database management tool. You can also use it to create reports.\r\nTo install, run:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\nbrew cask install valentina-studio\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you haven't heard of Homebrew-Cask, you may want to read on it. It allows you to install GUI applications in the Homebrew style.\r\n\r\nTo connect to your local database using Valentina Studio, enter in the user field your current username.\r\nBy default, there's no password created for the current user.\r\n\r\n\r\nRestore the database\r\n\r\nWe use Heroku for production and development. So I download the dump file from its dashboard and then run:\r\n<pre class='prettyprint'>\r\npg_restore file.dump -d your_db_name\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf you do have keys already added to github, just clone the repo.\r\nIf not,\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate virtual environment\r\n\r\nVirtual environment is a must for any new project.

501	How to wake up early\r	2015-12-01 04:41:24.825755-05	Waking up early (by that I mean by 5 am. Yes, that early!) has been one of my absolutely-necessary-to-achieve goals for quite some time now. However, I am not quite there yet. That's why I will follow Stefan Pylarinos advice and write my 55 (instead of 100) reasons of why I should be getting up before sunrise (or by 5 in the morning, because sunrise can be really late here in Scandinavia). According to Stefan, this will fire up your butt, when in doubt whether you should leave that warm pillow or just sleep in another hour. In reality, waking up early is hard because there are no compelling reasons why would you do that.\r\n\r\nAll righty, here they are. My 55 reasons of getting up by 5 am.\r\n\r\n1. I feel accomplished already in the early morning.\r\n2. I have time to do my morning meditation -> I am much more calm and my mind is clear.\r\n3. I get to see the wonderful sunrise, which 90% of people on Earth just miss.\r\n4. I develop the habits that are aligned with my values.\r\n5. I train my self-discipline.\r\n6. I get my pre-frontal cortex exercise.\r\n7. I am among the minority which does what it takes to get to the top.\r\n8. I get to write these awesome blogposts, and that I wouldn't be able to do otherwise, because of work.\r\n9. I get to practice Finnish, which lets me feel confident when I talk to Finnish people.\r\n10. I have no trouble getting up early when having a very early meeting or very early flight, which are way cheaper than the later ones.\r\n11. I am being admired by tons of other people for my discipline.\r\n12. I am being an example for other people, including my own family.\r\n13. I get to do super energyzing workouts, which I would have missed if I woke up later.\r\n14. I become wealthier, because by doing important things in the morning, I develop myself.\r\n15. I get to bring more value to the world, because I get to do valuable things which directly/indirectly impact others.\r\n16. I live to my fullest, because I do things which align with my personal values.\r\n17. I won't regret at my deathbed, that I haven't lived to my fullest.\r\n18. In the long run I will contribute to the world waay more if I get up earlier, instead of sleeping in. This will affect me mentally and will manifest in material wealth, no doubt.\r\n19. Because I become wealthier, I am able to help my family. Especially, my Mom who struggles.\r\n20. I will discover much more things and become wiser as the time goes. Every single day.\r\n21. I will get to travel the world and beyond, because I get things done in a productive way, because I am supercharged already in the very early morning.\r\n22. I feel much more excited and alive when I get up early. Morning stretches help immensely with wakin up.\r\n23. I am building habits that are important to me.\r\n24. My future kids will be able to learn from my habits and will eventually grow as wonderful human beings which will also contribute to the world.\r\n25. I am building a habit which will be one of the crucial ones for having own business.\r\n26. I will experience wealth & health that other people can only dream of.\r\n27. I will prove to the world that anyone can achieve anything they desire. If only they focus on it and invest time and efforts.\r\n28. I will influence immensely other people around me and beyond by showing a great example of human power and discipline.\r\n29. I will get over my fears, because I will build all the necessary beliefs and habits.\r\n30. I will live a long and a prosperous life.\r\n31. I will get to experience much more and get opportunities to build a life I desire.\r\n32. I have a great and vibrant health, with a body to admire.\r\n33. I am unstoppable, because I build momentum and I don't miss a day from being my best.\r\n34. I feel happy and energized.\r\n35. I feel like I can do anything. And that is true.\r\n36. I am positive and full of willpower.\r\n37. I have anything I want in my life: a house at the wonderful beaches, I car that makes people drool, a body to admire.\r\n38. Waking up early doesn't require an effort. It's just a habit.\r\n39. Going to sleep early isn't hard at all. It's also a habit. That way you also develop your other important habit: going to sleep early -> you feel amazing every day!\r\n40. Waking up at 5 am changes your entire life for better.\r\n41. Things align with your goals once you move towards them.\r\n42. You are independent of the opinions of other people, because you do what it takes and you have high levels of confidence.\r\n43. You are detached from surroundings and things are well.\r\n44. You have no addictions, because you got rid off them, while developing yourself in the early mornings.\r\n45. Waking up allows me to see things, I wouldn't be able to see otherwise.\r\n46. I get to exercise more, because I have more time to do it. And exercises make me happy!\r\n47. I get to the 5% (or even less) of people, who actually do it.\r\n48. I feel achieved and productive.\r\n49. I get to read more books, because I have more time to concentrate on personal development.\r\n50. I improve my health, because I walk more and exercise as well.\r\n51. I get to go to places when it's less crowded. There's also much less traffic and overall feeling is great when you walk around on an early Saturday or Sunday morning in the city center!\r\n52. You get best products from the shops before they are sold out.\r\n53. The air is cleaner in the mornings, so you get to breath the best.\r\n54. You can do fun things in the early mornings and not be distracted by others. That could be yoga, meditation and jogging.\r\n55. Your wealthiness level skyrockets both spiritually and financially for the all previous reasons!\r\n	Waking up early (by that I mean by 5 am.

506	Holidays on Crete, Chania	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	That's our second vacation in Chania (at Platanias, more precisely). Actually we are staying at the same exact hotel as last year. Even though it's not as exciting going to the same place twice, at the same time we know what to expect. I must say that having a beach close by, literally 50 meters from the hotel, is a huge plus.\r\n\r\nSo here's the reasons of why we chose Crete again. And what's worth doing around here.\r\n\r\ny number one reason is the quality of food. That's of course if you like vegetables and fruits as I do. They are just SO fresh and full of taste, juice and flavour. To say that salads here are much better than in Finland or Sweden would be an understatement. They are ten times better. And cheaper. To compare prices for grapes: 1 kg on Crete costs 1-2 euros, in Finland up to 3-5 euros. And the taste differences: that could be a whole new topic.\r\n<div class='pixels-photo'>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <img src='https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/122328325/m%3D900/9827e01b290e6ce6fe68e66fb132e970' alt='Real Greek salad by Elena Oat on 500px.com'>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <a href='https://500px.com/photo/122328325/real-greek-salad-by-elena-oat' alt='Real Greek salad by Elena Oat on 500px.com'></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://500px.com/embed.js'></script>\r\ny number two would be the beaches and the sea. The water is warm and clear, you can literally see tens of meters below. I am still wondering how come Greece isn't doing so well economically. They have such a treasure! Besides, it's the middle of September right now and the air temperature is still around 29-32 degrees Celsius. Don't know exactly what's the water temperature, but jumping into the water is far from being uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe nature and the landscape is merely breathtaking. Although, this is probably true for the whole Mediterranean area. Lagoons, gorges, caves - choose your own favorite. We went to the Samaria gorge hike last year and it was quite an experience.

505	Fall hiking in Scandinavian woods	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	Hiking in Swedish woods\r\n\r\nIf you've never hiked in the Scandinavian woods, you've got to do it! The nature is just gorgeous: remarkable pine trees with their distiguishable smell; wild blueberries (of course, at the right season) and mushrooms; calm and blue waters of the Baltic bays. We went for a hike right in the middle of September. It's still warm and the sun beams are encouraging for taking a walk. The leaves aren't autumny colorful just yet - but it will as marvellous here, in a different way, in just a few weeks!\r\n\r\nWe took pendeltåg from T Centralen to Kallhäl. From there it all started. The whole hike was rather easy. Only 10-11 kilometers and the difficulty just right for those aren't doing similar things on the weekly/monthly basis.\r\n\r\nWe hiked in a rather large group - 33 people. Plus, it was also very international. In fact, it was an event organized by the hiking group that can be found on meetup.com.\r\n\r\n<div class='pixels-photo'>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <img src='https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/122513765/m%3D900/e9427b46b902b0b3f2960efcc0ddbd7d' alt='Hiking in Stockholm by Elena Oat on 500px.com'>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <a href='https://500px.com/photo/122513765/hiking-in-stockholm-by-elena-oat' alt='Hiking in Stockholm by Elena Oat on 500px.com'></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://500px.com/embed.js'></script>\r\n\r\nBesides having a great hike in the woods, which we so rarely do, I got to meet quite a few interesting people. And I've got to know more about stem cells (!) than I've ever had any chance before! You never know, who you may meet at such gatherings: researchers, bus drivers, politicians, you name it!\r\n\r\nSo if you haven't been out in the forest this fall, I warmly urge you to do that. You won't regret it: I and the rest of 32 folks from our group, we promise!\r\n\r\n<div class='pixels-photo'>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <img src='https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/122514917/m%3D900/dd935fa0b094556c07222b5aeaead6d5' alt='Hiking by Elena Oat on 500px.com'>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <a href='https://500px.com/photo/122514917/hiking-by-elena-oat' alt='Hiking by Elena Oat on 500px.com'></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://500px.com/embed.js'></script>\r\n\r\n<i>Update</i>: Just one week later I had the chance to go to the next, and even more exciting, hike!.

Ok, I would maybe exercise. But do I really need to? I am already in a quite good shape. However, it proved to be super exciting and rewarding! I've actually met quite a few unordinary people and got inspired by their attitudes and the things they do.

The nature is just gorgeous: remarkable pine trees with their distiguishable smell; wild blueberries (of course, at the right season) and mushrooms; calm and blue waters of the Baltic bays. We went for a hike right in the middle of September. It's still warm and the sun beams are encouraging for taking a walk. The leaves aren't autumny colorful just yet - but it will as marvellous here, in a different way, in just a few weeks!\r\n\r\nWe took pendeltåg from T Centralen to Kallhäl. From there it all started. The whole hike was rather easy. Only 10-11 kilometers and the difficulty just right for those aren't doing similar things on the weekly/monthly basis.\r\n\r\nWe hiked in a rather large group - 33 people. Plus, it was also very international. In fact, it was an event organized by the hiking group that can be found on meetup.com.\r\n\r\n<div class='pixels-photo'>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <img src='https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/122513765/m%3D900/e9427b46b902b0b3f2960efcc0ddbd7d' alt='Hiking in Stockholm by Elena Oat on 500px.com'>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <a href='https://500px.com/photo/122513765/hiking-in-stockholm-by-elena-oat' alt='Hiking in Stockholm by Elena Oat on 500px.com'></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://500px.com/embed.js'></script>\r\n\r\nBesides having a great hike in the woods, which we so rarely do, I got to meet quite a few interesting people.

504	What to do in Crete	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	I will throw at you some ideas that I think may be useful if you decide to travel to Crete. I did. In fact, this is my second time here.\r\nWell, here they are:\r\n\r\n1. Visit Chania's old town.\r\nThe waterfront is expectantly impressive. Old picturesque buildings end with a spectacular lighthouse which has a lo-oong history. You can reach the lighthouse by walking on a wide "fence" of bricks. Probably hundreds if not thousands of people walk to the lighthouse every day. Next to the lighthouse you will also find fishermen trying their luck. And musicians, entertaining the public.\r\nThe whole waterfront is "packed" with restaurants and cafés. No need to worry about getting hungry. Most of them are quite busy, but nevertheless rather adorable. I find Greek pastel-toned chairs and tables with white tablecloths very attractive and cozy. Everyone sits on the patios to enjoy the cool Mediterranean breeze.\r\n<div class='pixels-photo'>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <img src='https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/122326583/m%3D900/369dd5b692b37af9ee4c7ecd3992b1d8' alt='The old lighthouse by Elena Oat on 500px.com'>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <a href='https://500px.com/photo/122326583/the-old-lighthouse-by-elena-oat' alt='The old lighthouse by Elena Oat on 500px.com'></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://500px.com/embed.js'></script>\r\n\r\n2. Snorkel or dive\r\nWe've gone diving last summer and it was quite an experience. Not to worry if you've never done it. The folks that organize it will explain to you everything. Also you don't need to worry about the equipment. They provide you with that too. The prices differ from place to another, but so do the choices of places for snorkeling and diving.\r\n\r\nediterranean is very convenient for these types of sports: with its clear, welcoming and warm water. If you've never done it, I guarantee you'll remember it.\r\n\r\n3. Take a trip to magnificent Elafonisi (or Elafonissi, go figure, they write it differently sometimes). There is an amazing lagoon with calm turquoise waters. Yes, just like how a paradisaic beach would look like. It has golden and red sand, which I've never seen before. There are even warning signs all over the beach that please do not steal the wonderful red sand.\r\n\r\nThe water is really calm, or at least we were fortunate enough to have it so. You can easily snorkel or just swim with goggles (mind you, the water is really salty, so it's kind of a requirement) and observe silver fish and other aquatic life around you.\r\n\r\n4. Have a look at the night sky while in Elafonisi. There's almost no light pollution, so you'll get to enjoy the Milky Way! That's probably the most awe-inspiring experience that I've had here. I've even forgotten we have all these stars, planets and other objects above our heads. You'll get to remember it and trust me, this experience alone is worth the trip to Elafonisi.\r\nWe took photos of the night sky and found the mysterious constellations, like Ursa Minora, Ursa Majora, Cassiopeia. Don't worry you don't have to know where exactly these are. I didn't either. We "cheated" and used an amazing app on iPhone which shows you all when you point the phone at the sky. It's unbelievably awesome what can you do today thanks to technology!\r\n\r\nIf you any of you are interested in finding out more about Crete, there's a wonderful blog out there:\r\n<a href="http://www.we-love-crete.com/Crete-blog.html">We love crete</a>\r\nThere you can find more stories about Crete written by other people, in addition to other useful information.\r\n	Read this if you would like to get some ideas on what to do on Crete, Greece.\r\n	what-to-do-in-crete	travel	What to do in Crete		Read this if you would like to get some ideas on what to do on Crete, Greece.\r\n		I will throw at you some ideas that I think may be useful if you decide to travel to Crete.

503	Learn languages online. Speak to your peers.	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	I will list my top 3 most effective, challenging, but at the same time fun ways to learn languages. And thanks to Internet today you may do it online.\r\n\r\n1. Talk, talk, talk!\r\n\r\nI cannot emphasize this enough, talking with native speakers is probably the most effective and quick way to learn languages. Try italki platform, there you may find people that want to do language exchange. I personally found 2 friends there with whom I practice my Finnish skills. In exchange, I teach them Russian. We talk every week on Skype. You might need to fight your shyness at the beginning, because these are the people you've never met, but trust me, this will be so rewarding at the end!\r\n\r\n2. Write more\r\n\r\nIf you don't feel confident enough to speak yet (you shouldn't, though!), you could start with something easier - writing texts. You will most certainly get to speak soon enough, if you put your focus to it. No doubts!\r\n\r\nWriting small essays is powerful. First of all, you learn new words. Second, you train your grammar skills.\r\nFor this to be fun, write essays on topics that interest you personally. You may want to write some made-up story about soon-to-be-yours penthouse. Or maybe you like to write fantasy or comics. In other words, be creative.\r\n\r\nFor this to be effective, you will want to send these texts to a friend for review. It would be optimal if the friend would explain their revisions personally, as he/she could point out why something is not exactly right. Although text corrections by email are good too.\r\n\r\nDo this in the early mornings, before you do anything else. And send it off to your friend. Then you know you are done with one important thing and this sets you up for a great day.\r\n\r\n3. Make notes of the expressions and words that are used by other native speakers.\r\n\r\nPay attention when people speak. What is it that they use when they talk about a specific situation. Write these down and then put them into memrise app (language learning app) for later review. I believe that people who are more attentive, learn languages more effectively. They notice how people use that or another word, whereas others just ignore these things. Try to pay attention from times to times to what exact words did a person use when speaking to you on italki/skype/you name it. You may even want to repeat same exact words to yo\r\n	I will list my top 3 most effective, challenging, but at the same time fun ways to learn languages.

Mutta nautimme leivoksia teen kanssa.\r\n\r\n================================================================\r\n\r\nKyläileminen (corrected version)\r\n\r\nKäyn ennemmin vierailemassa muiden luona kuin kutsun ketään vierailemaan luonani. En kutsu kavereitani, enkä perhettäni luokseni, koska asuntoni on todella pieni ja sinne ei mahdu isoa porukkaa.  Lisäksi minulla on todella pieni keittokomero, jossa minun on lähes mahdotonta laittaa ruokaa. Sen takia yleensä käymme syömässä kahviloissa tai jonkun toisen luona.\r\n\r\nTapaamme veljieni kanssa melkein joka viikonloppu. Menen autolla jomman kumman luokse ja lähdemme yhdessä kävelylle tai istumme vain pyödän ääressä ja juttelemme kaikenlaisista asioista. Joskus laitamme ruokaa yhdessä, joskus joku tuo jotain hyvää. Meidän perheessämme lähes kukaan ei juo enää kahvia, mutta nautimme leivoksia teen kanssa.\r\n\r\n<b>Nykymuoti on mautonta</b> (Modern fashion is tasteless)\r\n\r\nJotkut sanovat että nykymuoti on mautonta. En ole samaa mieltä. Tämä on niin kuin sanoa että luonnon olentoja ovat rumia. Olen sitä mieltä että kaikilla on oikeus olemassa. Varsinkin jos tämä, mistä on kyse, liittyy taiteeseen. Kuka määritelee mitä olisi maukasta ja mitä on mautonta? Tämä vain riippuu näkökulmasta.\r\n\r\nSamaa voi sanoa nykytaiteesta. Ihmiset monesti ei ymmärrä miten voi pitää nykytaiteesta, mutta tämä voi muuttua ajan kuluessa. Minusta, taidetta ei tarvitse aina arvioida. Voit kuitenkin pitää siitä tai ei. Mutta, mielestäni, ei ole oikea tai väärä tapa tehdä taidetta.\r\n\r\nJos määritetään miltä muoti pitäisi näyttää, poistetaan samaa aikaa luovuuden osa. Ja tämä rikkoa sen alkuperäisen merkityksen: tuoda uuttaa ja olla vapaata ja riippumattonta.\r\n\r\n================================================================\r\n\r\nNykymuoti on mautonta (corrected version)\r\n\r\nJotkut sanovat, että nykymuoti on mautonta.\r\nEn ole samaa mieltä.

497	YKI test: my experience	2015-12-01 04:41:24-05	This will be a short series of posts about preparing for YKI: how the test itself went, as well as useful resources for reference when preparing. In addition, I will submit my own texts and expressions which I've written during my preparation period. The texts will have the original and the corrected version. The latter is the text corrected by my Finnish friends, who were kind enough to help me prepare. I thought I could post both of them, so you may see my mistakes and learn from them too.\r\n\r\nSo here we are. First of all, do you know what is YKI testi? You probably do. Otherwise, you wouldn't have ended up on this page, most likely. Well, let me still say a few words about the test. YKI - abbreviation from Yleinen Kielitutkinto - is usually taken by people who want to prove their proficiency in Finnish. You usually need to take the test if you want to study in Finnish and that's not your native tongue. It's sort of TOEFL, but for Finnish.\r\n\r\nHowever, perhaps in most cases people take the test for Finnish citizenship. This is how it works here in Finland. You need to prove that you may explain yourself in Finnish and that you understand enough to become a citizen. That's, of course, common sense. Although, this isn't so common in the rest parts of the world.\r\n\r\nI will describe in the future posts how exactly I have prepared and what is worth paying attention to. Overall, I started preparing for the test 3 months before the actual exam, even though the most intensive was only the last month. In the end I felt like I was really ready to take it and forget about it. You know, it takes some energy to learn a language!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, stay tuned and check out more posts in Language Learning section! ;-)\r\n	I will describe my experience with YKI testi - yleinen kielitutkinto testi - a test verifying Finnish language proficiency.\r\n	yki-test-my-experience	learning-languages	YKI test: my experience		I will describe my experience with YKI testi - yleinen kielitutkinto testi - a test verifying Finnish language proficiency.\r\n		This will be a short series of posts about preparing for YKI: how the test itself went, as well as useful resources for reference when preparing.
